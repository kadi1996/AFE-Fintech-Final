"I've been looking for the market to bottom for several weeks. But the trading environment has shifted to a new gear; a cautionary one.  On the other hand, this sudden shift in sentiment may signal that a climactic selloff, often a prelude to a new uptrend, may be close at hand. Fingers crossed.Markets correct in two ways: via falling prices or through time via lengthy and painful consolidations. The current market had been in a time correction until last week when the bearish interest environment and the rising hostilities in the Middle East pushed bullish and neutral traders over to the bearish side.You can see this happening in the market's breadth (more on that below), and in the dearth of sectors that are in uptrends. An even more cautionary sign is the Cboe Volatility Index ($VIX) crossing above 20, a sign that bearish sentiment is rising to new levels.As a result, it makes sense to focus on cash, build a shopping list, and look well off the beaten path for stocks in areas of the market that may still provide some upside even as interest rates choke off much of everything else.Subscribers to Joe Duarte in the Money Options have been well positioned for this market via these five time-tested steps:Raising cash via positions that hit sell stops;Hedging of portfolios;Keeping position size small;Looking for relative strength in offbeat areas of the market andBuild a shopping list for when conditions improve.Energy Has the Momentum, For NowThe energy sector remains a bright light in an otherwise dimming market. This is especially evident in large-cap oil, oil exploration and production, and natural gas stocks. The two representative ETFs that illustrate this point best are the iShares Oil &amp; Gas Exploration &amp; Production ETF (IEO) and the First Trust Natural Gas ETF (FCG).Both price charts are intuitively bullish, given their current uptrends, their trading near their recent highs, and the bullish rise in both Accumulation/Distribution (ADI) and On Balance Volume (OBV). Moreover, seasonal tendencies, as winter approaches and the rapidly evolving developments in the Middle East support higher prices in crude oil. In addition, disruptions in the oil supply resulting from the Israel-Palestinian conflict could lead to more money moving into natural gas companies as the liquified natural gas (LNG) market heats up again.On the other hand, if these strong sectors roll over, it would signal that a full-blown market correction is unfolding.I recently posted two new energy stock trades at JoeDuarteintheMoneyOptions.com. Have a look with a Free Trial here.Off The Radar Interesting StuffSometimes, it pays to look well beyond the mainstream, especially during geopolitical stress. Global commerce isn't going anywhere despite the macro trend of relocating factories and supply chains to friendly neighbors (friend-shoring/near-shoring). That's because some universal commodities are grown in specific parts of the world and not others—think coffee, cocoa, and yes, oil and natural gas.That brings the global shipping industry to the forefront. The mainstream view, which leaders in the shipping industry support, is that times are about to get worse for the sector. Many in the industry are forecasting a global recession as they moan about falling contract rates and rising costs.Yet a look at the SonicShares Global Shipping ETF (BOAT) shows that investors have been putting money to work in the sector. Granted, it's a niche play and a small ETF with only $20 million in assets while trading in very low volumes. Moreover, it's important to note that the stocks in this ETF are not household words and that sellers may gain the upper hand if the market climate fully sours.For example, the ETF's biggest holding is Japanese shipper Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd, which is not US traded. The only US-based company in its top holdings is Honolulu-based Matson Inc. (MATX), whose shares have had a decent run over the last few months and have recently entered a consolidation pattern.Certainly, even as its stock has done well, MATX is not without risk as the company provides shipping and logistics along the Trans-Pacific sector and services to Hawaii, Alaska, and Guam. The most recent earnings report beat expectations but also sounded a cautionary note, focusing on the economic risks of an economic downturn in the U.S. and other potential problems involving the Chinese economy.The flip side is that shipping costs will rise if a protracted war further disrupts the global supply chains and that companies like Matson will have pricing power.My point in highlighting BOAT and Matson is not to recommend their shares but to illustrate the lengths investors may have to go to, especially the allowances to risk that may be required to uncover sectors and companies which may be worth considering in the current times.Join the smart money at JoeDuarteintheMoneyOptions.com.

Unfortunately,  looks as if we're heading for a test of the March lows as the May support level has given way.  A break below the March and May bottoms, as highlighted by the trend lines on the chart, would be doubly bearish.  On the other hand, any further weakness in NYAD would lead to an oversold reading in the RSI (circled area), which could be the final washout of this correction.The Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX) broke below its 50-day moving average decisively and is testing the bottom of a major VBP support level (marked by the trend line).  ADI and OBV both turned lower as selling pressure built. Again, as with SPX below, RSI is nearly oversold.The S&amp;P 500 (SPX) fell below its 200-day moving average and entered an important support level of 4150 and 4250 (highlighted by trend lines based on VBP bars).  ADI and OBV turned lower, signaling rising selling pressure.VIX Crosses Above 20, Signaling Rising Fear  The VIX has finally crossed above the important 20 level, which has kept the bears in check up to now.  If this is not reversed, it will likely cause more trouble in the next few days to weeks.When the VIX rises, stocks tend to fall as its rise signifies that traders are buying large volumes of put options.  Rising put option volume from fearful traders leads market makers to sell stock index futures to hedge their put sales to the public.  A fall in VIX is bullish as it means less put option buying, and it eventually leads to call buying, which causes market makers to hedge by buying stock index futures, raising the odds of higher stock prices.To get the latest information on options trading, check out Options Trading for Dummies, now in its 4th Edition—Get Your Copy Now!

"Over the past six trading days, NVDA has fallen from a high of 476.09 to Friday's low of 410.78.  That's a drop of 65.31, or nearly 14%, in just over one week.  Would it make sense to take advantage of this selling?  Well, like any other stock, NVDA is subject to overall market headwinds or tailwinds.  Currently, there are plenty of headwinds and there are also reasons to believe these headwinds will persist in the very near-term.  I discussed the current environment in an article I published earlier today, ""Odds Favor Further Selling This Week (Maybe a LOT of it)"".  Be sure to check it out.  Part of trading and/or investing success boils down to preparation.  For those interested in NVDA, check out its 20-year seasonality chart from 2003 to 2022:Do you notice that the probability of monthly gains spikes in the second month of each calendar quarter - February, May, August, and November?  Those are the four most likely calendar months that we'll see gains in NVDA.  And how about those average monthly returns?  To summarize, here's how the average returns break down by calendar quarter months:1st month of calendar quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct):  +2.5%2nd month of calendar quarter (Feb, May, Aug, Nov):  +30.1%3rd month of calendar quarter (Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec):  +5.5%NVDA has been a tremendous performer, actually one of the best-performing stocks of this century.  But did you know that the second calendar month of each calendar quarter is responsible for most of those gains?  There's one reason for this bullish timing on NVDA - earnings!  NVDA typically reports earnings in February, May, August, and November.  And earnings drive prices.  There's a TON of NVDA accumulation (by big Wall Street firms) heading into earnings each quarter.  That's why we see those crazy returns when we compare the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd months of calendar quarters.  Knowing this type of information can be a real game changer for traders, wouldn't you agree?  Don't you feel like your odds of winning trades on NVDA just improved?I'm a stock market history buff.

"I've been watching the Volatility Index ($VIX) for years and it provides us a number of very important signals.  One of those signals is BE CAREFUL when the VIX moves from the teens and into the 20s.  In my experience, moving from 13 to 15 isn't the same as moving from 19 to 21.  We saw the latter last week and, if history is any guide, we need to be very cautious as we approaching this week.History of VIX Moving Above 20We've had plenty of bouts with fear rising, even during the past 10-11 years of secular bull market action.  Yes, I believe we remain solidly in a secular bull market.  I've said it repeatedly, because that's what I believe and what I see in my longer-term signals.  You may not agree with me, and that's fine, but I do have conviction.  Without conviction of the Big Picture, the market's ups and downs will make investing/trading emotionally exhausting.  ""We're in a bull market!  No, now we're in a bear market!""  One day, the sky is falling.  The next day, we have glorious sunshine.  How do you cope with it?  Well, it's having a solid grasp of how the stock market works.  Fear comes and goes and it's measured in multiple ways.  Today, let's focus on the VIX.  The escalation of fear is what drives very rapid acceleration in selling.  If you study history, you'll see that every significant selloff this century has coincided with a VIX reading that soars above 20.  But not every move above 20 results in a major selloff.  Not only do we need to be aware when the VIX moves through 20, but we also need to realize that we're at a very important juncture short-term.  In my opinion, the current secular bull market began on April 10, 2013, when the S&amp;P 500 cleared previous price tops in 2000 and 2007.  Here's the chart that validates what I believe was the start of the current secular bull market:The red-shaded area represents the last secular bear market, where we literally had no new highs on the S&amp;P 500 for 13 years.  I believe it's rather obvious to see that we're now in an uptrend, despite several major bumps in the road.  Since that 2013 breakout, I count 36 times that the VIX has broken from the teens to above 20, signaling rising fear that we need to be aware of.  Of the prior 35 occurrences, 23 resulted in almost immediate bottoms.  That is, in roughly 2 out of 3 occurrences, the VIX trip above 20 marked a significant bottom.  Let me provide you several 2019 examples in the following chart:The VIX trips above 20 didn't last and, essentially, that initial close above 20 marked the S&amp;P 500 bottom.  But, in approximately one-third of these jumps through 20, the VIX signals us something more serious in the near-term.  Here's an S&amp;P 500 chart since the trade war days of Q4 2018, highlighting the more serious VIX warnings above 20:These examples were much more serious and selling escalated rapidly.  Avoiding that short-term carnage would make a huge difference in a trader's account.  By the way, keep in mind that the current secular bull market has withstood all 35 prior occurrences.  On Thursday and Friday of last week, the VIX jumped to close back above 20.  But is this latest spike in fear going to result like 23 of the prior such jumps and mark the bottom now?  Or will the fear continue to escalate and send prices lower rapidly?  Well, there are no guarantees, but I believe it's prudent to believe that the odds of prices tanking this week, at least for a couple days, is stronger than 33%.I have two reasons that support this notion of lower prices in the week ahead.Bearish Technical Price ActionWe only need to look at the S&amp;P 500 daily chart to see the technical issues present at Friday's close:The VIX breaking above 20 is a warning sign, but I believe it's more important that the S&amp;P 500 closed on its low on Friday on increasing volume.  This is NOT capitulation.  In fact, it reeks of further selling ahead, until we see capitulation.  Selloffs can be MUCH more brutal when price support is lost with a VIX above 20.  So technical issues are telling me to be very careful.Historical BearishnessNext week is the absolute WORST week of the year historically, dating back to 1950 on the S&amp;P 500.  While the S&amp;P 500's average annual returns are approximately +9% over the past 73 years, check out the following annualized returns by calendar day on the S&amp;P 500 over those same 73 years:October 22nd (today):  -90.58%October 23rd (Monday):  -5.14%October 24th (Tuesday):  -32.64%October 25th (Wednesday):  -36.65%October 26th (Thursday):  -56.01%October 27th (Friday):  -24.27%Those numbers are a far cry from the S&amp;P 500's average annual return of +9%.And if you think things are better historically on the NASDAQ, think again.  Here are the annualized returns by calendar day on the NASDAQ since 1971:October 22nd (today):  -58.57%October 23rd (Monday):  -46.02%October 24th (Tuesday):  -64.64%October 25th (Wednesday):  -25.00%October 26th (Thursday):  -106.39%October 27th (Friday):  -78.14%Now I'm not providing any guarantees about price action next week.  Rather, I'm talking about tendencies and probabilities.  The VIX is screaming at us to be very careful, price action is suggesting lower prices ahead, and history shows very bearish tendencies in the week ahead.  Personally, I do not ignore those warning signs.The Silver LiningThe primary silver lining for me is that every important signal I follow says this weakness will be short-lived and that the current secular bull market will return stronger than ever.  The track record of these signals has been very strong for a decade.  The other silver lining, however, is that historical tendencies will soon flip to the side of the bulls.

"The markets wore a largely corrective undertone throughout the past five sessions; it oscillated within a similar range as the previous week and closed on a negative note. The volatility remained on the lower side; as the volatility has been low, the bands contracted as well. As compared to the 362-point trading range in the week before this one, this time, the Nifty oscillated in a 337.40-point range before closing towards its lower end. While continuing to defend key support levels, the headline index closed with a net loss of 208.40 points (-1.06%) on a weekly basis.From a technical perspective, there are a few important things that one needs to keep in mind. The Nifty has again closed very near to the 20-week MA which is currently placed at 19437. This makes the level of 19400 the most important near-term support for the Nifty on a closing basis. Any violation of this point on a closing basis will take the index to its original breakout zone of 18900-19000 levels. The volatility, as represented by INDIA Vix, also remains at one of its lowest levels. The INDIAVIX rose marginally by 1.88% to 10.82 on a weekly note. This technical structure keeps the market vulnerable to profit-taking bouts from the current levels.The coming week is a truncated week once again with Tuesday being a trading holiday on the account of Dussehra. We also have monthly derivatives expiry slated to come up later in the week. A soft start to the week is expected on Monday; the levels of 19650 and 19800 are expected to act as resistance points. The supports are likely to come in at 19400 and 19330 levels.The weekly RSI is 57.58; it has marked a new 14-period low which is bearish. The RSI also shows a bearish divergence against the price. The weekly MACD is bearish and trades below its signal line.The pattern analysis of the weekly chart indicates that the markets will have their upside capped and they have also dragged their resistance points lower from 20000 to 19800 levels. All technical rebounds will find resistance at this point. Further to this, the index has also closed very near to the 20-week MA currently placed at 19437. So, in the event of any extended corrective move, the index is expected to seek support at this point, i.e., the 20-week MA. If this gets violated, it will invite incremental weakness.All in all, unless rollover and expiry-centric moves cause technical rebounds, the markets are likely to largely exhibit a continued corrective undertone. There are possibilities that defensive pockets shall do well; it would be wise to stay invested in defensive and low-beta pockets. Besides being highly stock-specific, exposures should be kept limited to those stocks that show strong relative strength against the broader markets. While cutting down on excessively leveraged positions, all up-moves, if and when they occur, should be used to protect profits. A cautious outlook is advised for the day.Sector Analysis for the coming weekIn our look at Relative Rotation Graphs®, we compared various sectors against CNX500 (NIFTY 500 Index), which represents over 95% of the free float market cap of all the stocks listed.Relative Rotation Graphs (RRG) indicate that the Nifty IT, Energy, Midcap 100, Media, PSU Bank, PSE, Metal, and Infrastructure indices are inside the leading quadrant and are expected to relatively outperform the broader markets. However, some slowdown in their performance can also be expected because barring the Infrastructure and the PSE Index, all other groups are paring their relative momentum against the broader markets.Nifty Realty, Pharma, and Auto Index are inside the weakening quadrant. Except for the Pharma index, the other two are showing strong improvement in their relative momentum against the broader markets.The FMCG, Consumption, Financial Services, and Banknifty are inside the lagging quadrant. However, all these groups are improving their relative momentum as appears from the trajectory of the tail.The Services Sector and the Commodities Index are inside the improving quadrant.Important Note: RRG™ charts show the relative strength and momentum of a group of stocks. In the above Chart, they show relative performance against NIFTY500 Index (Broader Markets) and should not be used directly as buy or sell signals.  Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA Consulting Technical Analyst www.EquityResearch.asia | www.ChartWizard.ae ",stockcharts,2023-10-23 15:21:40.375366,no
