"I've been looking for the market to bottom for several weeks. But the trading environment has shifted to a new gear; a cautionary one.  On the other hand, this sudden shift in sentiment may signal that a climactic selloff, often a prelude to a new uptrend, may be close at hand. Fingers crossed.Markets correct in two ways: via falling prices or through time via lengthy and painful consolidations. The current market had been in a time correction until last week when the bearish interest environment and the rising hostilities in the Middle East pushed bullish and neutral traders over to the bearish side.You can see this happening in the market's breadth (more on that below), and in the dearth of sectors that are in uptrends. An even more cautionary sign is the Cboe Volatility Index ($VIX) crossing above 20, a sign that bearish sentiment is rising to new levels.As a result, it makes sense to focus on cash, build a shopping list, and look well off the beaten path for stocks in areas of the market that may still provide some upside even as interest rates choke off much of everything else.Subscribers to Joe Duarte in the Money Options have been well positioned for this market via these five time-tested steps:Raising cash via positions that hit sell stops;Hedging of portfolios;Keeping position size small;Looking for relative strength in offbeat areas of the market andBuild a shopping list for when conditions improve.Energy Has the Momentum, For NowThe energy sector remains a bright light in an otherwise dimming market. This is especially evident in large-cap oil, oil exploration and production, and natural gas stocks. The two representative ETFs that illustrate this point best are the iShares Oil &amp; Gas Exploration &amp; Production ETF (IEO) and the First Trust Natural Gas ETF (FCG).Both price charts are intuitively bullish, given their current uptrends, their trading near their recent highs, and the bullish rise in both Accumulation/Distribution (ADI) and On Balance Volume (OBV). Moreover, seasonal tendencies, as winter approaches and the rapidly evolving developments in the Middle East support higher prices in crude oil. In addition, disruptions in the oil supply resulting from the Israel-Palestinian conflict could lead to more money moving into natural gas companies as the liquified natural gas (LNG) market heats up again.On the other hand, if these strong sectors roll over, it would signal that a full-blown market correction is unfolding.I recently posted two new energy stock trades at JoeDuarteintheMoneyOptions.com. Have a look with a Free Trial here.Off The Radar Interesting StuffSometimes, it pays to look well beyond the mainstream, especially during geopolitical stress. Global commerce isn't going anywhere despite the macro trend of relocating factories and supply chains to friendly neighbors (friend-shoring/near-shoring). That's because some universal commodities are grown in specific parts of the world and not others—think coffee, cocoa, and yes, oil and natural gas.That brings the global shipping industry to the forefront. The mainstream view, which leaders in the shipping industry support, is that times are about to get worse for the sector. Many in the industry are forecasting a global recession as they moan about falling contract rates and rising costs.Yet a look at the SonicShares Global Shipping ETF (BOAT) shows that investors have been putting money to work in the sector. Granted, it's a niche play and a small ETF with only $20 million in assets while trading in very low volumes. Moreover, it's important to note that the stocks in this ETF are not household words and that sellers may gain the upper hand if the market climate fully sours.For example, the ETF's biggest holding is Japanese shipper Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd, which is not US traded. The only US-based company in its top holdings is Honolulu-based Matson Inc. (MATX), whose shares have had a decent run over the last few months and have recently entered a consolidation pattern.Certainly, even as its stock has done well, MATX is not without risk as the company provides shipping and logistics along the Trans-Pacific sector and services to Hawaii, Alaska, and Guam. The most recent earnings report beat expectations but also sounded a cautionary note, focusing on the economic risks of an economic downturn in the U.S. and other potential problems involving the Chinese economy.The flip side is that shipping costs will rise if a protracted war further disrupts the global supply chains and that companies like Matson will have pricing power.My point in highlighting BOAT and Matson is not to recommend their shares but to illustrate the lengths investors may have to go to, especially the allowances to risk that may be required to uncover sectors and companies which may be worth considering in the current times.Join the smart money at JoeDuarteintheMoneyOptions.com.

Unfortunately,  looks as if we're heading for a test of the March lows as the May support level has given way.  A break below the March and May bottoms, as highlighted by the trend lines on the chart, would be doubly bearish.  On the other hand, any further weakness in NYAD would lead to an oversold reading in the RSI (circled area), which could be the final washout of this correction.The Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX) broke below its 50-day moving average decisively and is testing the bottom of a major VBP support level (marked by the trend line).  ADI and OBV both turned lower as selling pressure built. Again, as with SPX below, RSI is nearly oversold.The S&amp;P 500 (SPX) fell below its 200-day moving average and entered an important support level of 4150 and 4250 (highlighted by trend lines based on VBP bars).  ADI and OBV turned lower, signaling rising selling pressure.VIX Crosses Above 20, Signaling Rising Fear  The VIX has finally crossed above the important 20 level, which has kept the bears in check up to now.  If this is not reversed, it will likely cause more trouble in the next few days to weeks.When the VIX rises, stocks tend to fall as its rise signifies that traders are buying large volumes of put options.  Rising put option volume from fearful traders leads market makers to sell stock index futures to hedge their put sales to the public.  A fall in VIX is bullish as it means less put option buying, and it eventually leads to call buying, which causes market makers to hedge by buying stock index futures, raising the odds of higher stock prices.To get the latest information on options trading, check out Options Trading for Dummies, now in its 4th Edition—Get Your Copy Now!

"Over the past six trading days, NVDA has fallen from a high of 476.09 to Friday's low of 410.78.  That's a drop of 65.31, or nearly 14%, in just over one week.  Would it make sense to take advantage of this selling?  Well, like any other stock, NVDA is subject to overall market headwinds or tailwinds.  Currently, there are plenty of headwinds and there are also reasons to believe these headwinds will persist in the very near-term.  I discussed the current environment in an article I published earlier today, ""Odds Favor Further Selling This Week (Maybe a LOT of it)"".  Be sure to check it out.  Part of trading and/or investing success boils down to preparation.  For those interested in NVDA, check out its 20-year seasonality chart from 2003 to 2022:Do you notice that the probability of monthly gains spikes in the second month of each calendar quarter - February, May, August, and November?  Those are the four most likely calendar months that we'll see gains in NVDA.  And how about those average monthly returns?  To summarize, here's how the average returns break down by calendar quarter months:1st month of calendar quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct):  +2.5%2nd month of calendar quarter (Feb, May, Aug, Nov):  +30.1%3rd month of calendar quarter (Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec):  +5.5%NVDA has been a tremendous performer, actually one of the best-performing stocks of this century.  But did you know that the second calendar month of each calendar quarter is responsible for most of those gains?  There's one reason for this bullish timing on NVDA - earnings!  NVDA typically reports earnings in February, May, August, and November.  And earnings drive prices.  There's a TON of NVDA accumulation (by big Wall Street firms) heading into earnings each quarter.  That's why we see those crazy returns when we compare the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd months of calendar quarters.  Knowing this type of information can be a real game changer for traders, wouldn't you agree?  Don't you feel like your odds of winning trades on NVDA just improved?I'm a stock market history buff.

"I've been watching the Volatility Index ($VIX) for years and it provides us a number of very important signals.  One of those signals is BE CAREFUL when the VIX moves from the teens and into the 20s.  In my experience, moving from 13 to 15 isn't the same as moving from 19 to 21.  We saw the latter last week and, if history is any guide, we need to be very cautious as we approaching this week.History of VIX Moving Above 20We've had plenty of bouts with fear rising, even during the past 10-11 years of secular bull market action.  Yes, I believe we remain solidly in a secular bull market.  I've said it repeatedly, because that's what I believe and what I see in my longer-term signals.  You may not agree with me, and that's fine, but I do have conviction.  Without conviction of the Big Picture, the market's ups and downs will make investing/trading emotionally exhausting.  ""We're in a bull market!  No, now we're in a bear market!""  One day, the sky is falling.  The next day, we have glorious sunshine.  How do you cope with it?  Well, it's having a solid grasp of how the stock market works.  Fear comes and goes and it's measured in multiple ways.  Today, let's focus on the VIX.  The escalation of fear is what drives very rapid acceleration in selling.  If you study history, you'll see that every significant selloff this century has coincided with a VIX reading that soars above 20.  But not every move above 20 results in a major selloff.  Not only do we need to be aware when the VIX moves through 20, but we also need to realize that we're at a very important juncture short-term.  In my opinion, the current secular bull market began on April 10, 2013, when the S&amp;P 500 cleared previous price tops in 2000 and 2007.  Here's the chart that validates what I believe was the start of the current secular bull market:The red-shaded area represents the last secular bear market, where we literally had no new highs on the S&amp;P 500 for 13 years.  I believe it's rather obvious to see that we're now in an uptrend, despite several major bumps in the road.  Since that 2013 breakout, I count 36 times that the VIX has broken from the teens to above 20, signaling rising fear that we need to be aware of.  Of the prior 35 occurrences, 23 resulted in almost immediate bottoms.  That is, in roughly 2 out of 3 occurrences, the VIX trip above 20 marked a significant bottom.  Let me provide you several 2019 examples in the following chart:The VIX trips above 20 didn't last and, essentially, that initial close above 20 marked the S&amp;P 500 bottom.  But, in approximately one-third of these jumps through 20, the VIX signals us something more serious in the near-term.  Here's an S&amp;P 500 chart since the trade war days of Q4 2018, highlighting the more serious VIX warnings above 20:These examples were much more serious and selling escalated rapidly.  Avoiding that short-term carnage would make a huge difference in a trader's account.  By the way, keep in mind that the current secular bull market has withstood all 35 prior occurrences.  On Thursday and Friday of last week, the VIX jumped to close back above 20.  But is this latest spike in fear going to result like 23 of the prior such jumps and mark the bottom now?  Or will the fear continue to escalate and send prices lower rapidly?  Well, there are no guarantees, but I believe it's prudent to believe that the odds of prices tanking this week, at least for a couple days, is stronger than 33%.I have two reasons that support this notion of lower prices in the week ahead.Bearish Technical Price ActionWe only need to look at the S&amp;P 500 daily chart to see the technical issues present at Friday's close:The VIX breaking above 20 is a warning sign, but I believe it's more important that the S&amp;P 500 closed on its low on Friday on increasing volume.  This is NOT capitulation.  In fact, it reeks of further selling ahead, until we see capitulation.  Selloffs can be MUCH more brutal when price support is lost with a VIX above 20.  So technical issues are telling me to be very careful.Historical BearishnessNext week is the absolute WORST week of the year historically, dating back to 1950 on the S&amp;P 500.  While the S&amp;P 500's average annual returns are approximately +9% over the past 73 years, check out the following annualized returns by calendar day on the S&amp;P 500 over those same 73 years:October 22nd (today):  -90.58%October 23rd (Monday):  -5.14%October 24th (Tuesday):  -32.64%October 25th (Wednesday):  -36.65%October 26th (Thursday):  -56.01%October 27th (Friday):  -24.27%Those numbers are a far cry from the S&amp;P 500's average annual return of +9%.And if you think things are better historically on the NASDAQ, think again.  Here are the annualized returns by calendar day on the NASDAQ since 1971:October 22nd (today):  -58.57%October 23rd (Monday):  -46.02%October 24th (Tuesday):  -64.64%October 25th (Wednesday):  -25.00%October 26th (Thursday):  -106.39%October 27th (Friday):  -78.14%Now I'm not providing any guarantees about price action next week.  Rather, I'm talking about tendencies and probabilities.  The VIX is screaming at us to be very careful, price action is suggesting lower prices ahead, and history shows very bearish tendencies in the week ahead.  Personally, I do not ignore those warning signs.The Silver LiningThe primary silver lining for me is that every important signal I follow says this weakness will be short-lived and that the current secular bull market will return stronger than ever.  The track record of these signals has been very strong for a decade.  The other silver lining, however, is that historical tendencies will soon flip to the side of the bulls.

"The markets wore a largely corrective undertone throughout the past five sessions; it oscillated within a similar range as the previous week and closed on a negative note. The volatility remained on the lower side; as the volatility has been low, the bands contracted as well. As compared to the 362-point trading range in the week before this one, this time, the Nifty oscillated in a 337.40-point range before closing towards its lower end. While continuing to defend key support levels, the headline index closed with a net loss of 208.40 points (-1.06%) on a weekly basis.From a technical perspective, there are a few important things that one needs to keep in mind. The Nifty has again closed very near to the 20-week MA which is currently placed at 19437. This makes the level of 19400 the most important near-term support for the Nifty on a closing basis. Any violation of this point on a closing basis will take the index to its original breakout zone of 18900-19000 levels. The volatility, as represented by INDIA Vix, also remains at one of its lowest levels. The INDIAVIX rose marginally by 1.88% to 10.82 on a weekly note. This technical structure keeps the market vulnerable to profit-taking bouts from the current levels.The coming week is a truncated week once again with Tuesday being a trading holiday on the account of Dussehra. We also have monthly derivatives expiry slated to come up later in the week. A soft start to the week is expected on Monday; the levels of 19650 and 19800 are expected to act as resistance points. The supports are likely to come in at 19400 and 19330 levels.The weekly RSI is 57.58; it has marked a new 14-period low which is bearish. The RSI also shows a bearish divergence against the price. The weekly MACD is bearish and trades below its signal line.The pattern analysis of the weekly chart indicates that the markets will have their upside capped and they have also dragged their resistance points lower from 20000 to 19800 levels. All technical rebounds will find resistance at this point. Further to this, the index has also closed very near to the 20-week MA currently placed at 19437. So, in the event of any extended corrective move, the index is expected to seek support at this point, i.e., the 20-week MA. If this gets violated, it will invite incremental weakness.All in all, unless rollover and expiry-centric moves cause technical rebounds, the markets are likely to largely exhibit a continued corrective undertone. There are possibilities that defensive pockets shall do well; it would be wise to stay invested in defensive and low-beta pockets. Besides being highly stock-specific, exposures should be kept limited to those stocks that show strong relative strength against the broader markets. While cutting down on excessively leveraged positions, all up-moves, if and when they occur, should be used to protect profits. A cautious outlook is advised for the day.Sector Analysis for the coming weekIn our look at Relative Rotation Graphs®, we compared various sectors against CNX500 (NIFTY 500 Index), which represents over 95% of the free float market cap of all the stocks listed.Relative Rotation Graphs (RRG) indicate that the Nifty IT, Energy, Midcap 100, Media, PSU Bank, PSE, Metal, and Infrastructure indices are inside the leading quadrant and are expected to relatively outperform the broader markets. However, some slowdown in their performance can also be expected because barring the Infrastructure and the PSE Index, all other groups are paring their relative momentum against the broader markets.Nifty Realty, Pharma, and Auto Index are inside the weakening quadrant. Except for the Pharma index, the other two are showing strong improvement in their relative momentum against the broader markets.The FMCG, Consumption, Financial Services, and Banknifty are inside the lagging quadrant. However, all these groups are improving their relative momentum as appears from the trajectory of the tail.The Services Sector and the Commodities Index are inside the improving quadrant.Important Note: RRG™ charts show the relative strength and momentum of a group of stocks. In the above Chart, they show relative performance against NIFTY500 Index (Broader Markets) and should not be used directly as buy or sell signals.  Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA Consulting Technical Analyst www.EquityResearch.asia | www.ChartWizard.ae ",stockcharts,2023-10-23 15:21:40.375366

She also trades below the July 6-month calendar range low.Furthermore, SMH now underperforms SPY and the momentum on Real Motion shows a bearish divergence as momentum is under the moving averages, which are in a bearish phase.This is a potential game-changer.

That makes me shudder.Big Brother Biotech IBB never really got going in 2023. IBB peaked in August 2021 post-covid.Biotech trades under its 80-month or six to seven-year business cycle as well. This breakdown is concerning and points to much weaker economic times ahead.And Regional Banks or my dear Prodigal Son?Well, he has one foot out the door. By that I mean, out of the Family.Here's why.When I created the Economic Modern Family, Regional Banks, and not big banks were included as a reliable way to assess the small urban and more rural communities' trends on borrowing money.A good sign for the economy is when Regional Banks do well and ""local"" folks are borrowing and successfully paying back loans to expand their lifestyles.I called the sector Prodigal Son after 2008 because of the bible story.  The Banking sector is often lavish, then contrite when it oversteps, costing Americans dollars. Since March 2023, during the ""bank crisis"", KRE and many of the companies in that ETF basket have done nothing price-wise.Broadening out the chart to March, since the decline, KRE has traded in a $10 range.Now, that is a lot better than breaking the March lows if one wants to look at it optimistically.Nonetheless, the trading range could be more a result of the rest of the market holding up or just a general lack of interest in this sector.Or it could be a speedbump before the eventual annihilation of Regional Banks.That would leave me with a new chapter of the Family-do we kill off or merely send away our Prodigal Son?And do we think KRE should be replaced with big banks or XLF?Here's where our newest member comes in—Crypto.But that's an article for another time.And, if you check out the Crypto Town Hall X Spaces below, you can hear some of our thoughts.This is for educational purposes only.

"Stock market action in the last few months reflects how quickly investor sentiment can change. Federal Reserve Chairman Powell's comments on Thursday implied that inflation is still high and the US economy continues to be strong. Although there's a high probability that interest rates will remain unchanged in the November meeting, it's unclear what the agenda will be for the December meeting. Powell's remarks didn't help the broader equity markets, which closed lower for the week on Friday. The daily chart of the S&amp;P 500 below shows that market breadth is also weakening in addition to the index battling with its 200-day simple moving average support. CHART 1: S&amp;P 500 TRENDING LOWER. The index closed below its 200-day moving average, and the percentage of stocks trading below their 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving averages are also trending lower. Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.The percentage of S&amp;P 500 stocks trading above their 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving averages are declining.  Bond Yields RiseThe higher-for-longer interest rate narrative helped long-dated bond yields. The 30-year US Treasury yield is around 5.1%, and the 10-year US Treasury is close to 5%. The higher yields are having an impact on the banking sector. The daily chart of the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) shows the ETF is getting close to its May levels, when the US regional banking crisis occurred. Big banks are feeling the pain as well. The SPDR S&amp;P Bank ETF (KBE) also displays a similar price action as KRE. CHART 2: REGIONAL BANKS FALL AS YIELDS RISE. Regional banks, as well as the big banks, have been feeling the pain of higher interest rates. Price levels are close to where they were in May when the regional bank fiasco occurred. Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.Bond spreads are showing some significant action. The 10-year/2-year bond spread (see chart below) is rising steeply and is at -0.16. The same can be said about the 10-year-3-month spread. The 30-year/3-year and 30-year/5-year spreads are also trending higher. The steepening yield curves support Chairman Powell's statements about the strong economy and high inflation. And this increases investor uncertainty. CHART 2: 10-YEAR/2-YEAR US TREASURY SPREAD. Long-dated bonds are up, which steepens the spread between the 10- and 2-year Treasury yields. Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.Interestingly, while interest rates are rising, gold prices have been rising, which is unusual. This indicates that investors are jittery about global events and are leaning toward risk-off sentiment. Check out the Dynamic Yield Curve on the StockCharts charting platform.Turning to VolatilityYou'd think the present uncertainties would send volatility through the roof. Yet, the Cboe Volatility Index ($VIX), considered to be a fear gauge, hasn't shown signs of outlandish panic. The VIX tends to move inversely to the S&amp;P 500. When the S&amp;P 500 falls, VIX rises, and when fear is extreme, the VIX spikes. Although the VIX hasn't been showing outlandish levels of fear, it has been trending higher since mid-September, which needs to be watched closely. CHART 3: CBOE VOLATILITY INDEX (VIX) WITH 30-DAY MOVING AVERAGE OVERLAY. Although the VIX isn't at ""panic levels"" it's rising and has moved above the complacent 20 level. Keep an eye on this. Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.We are in the midst of escalated geopolitical tensions, interest rates are rising, a speakerless House of Representative, and so on.

"The Relative Rotation Graph above could not be more clear. Large Caps are leading the dance at the moment.The rotations of the tails for Mid- and Small-cap stocks are rolling over and entering the lagging quadrant again. This means that they are embarking on a new leg lower in an already existing relative downtrend.The opposite goes for the Large Cap tail, which has just curled back up inside the weakening quadrant and is now heading back into the leading quadrant.Stacking the Three Size IndicesThis can also be seen very well by just eye-balling the charts when we plot all three indices under each other. From the lowest point in the large-cap chart, Large caps are still almost 8% higher than where they started at the end of April. Mid-caps and Small-Caps are pretty much unchanged at +0.2% and 0.1%.Measuring the decline from the highest point in the last week of July, Large caps are down 6.4%, while Mid-caps are down almost 10% and Small-caps almost 12%.So, despite the current weakness in all market segments, Large-caps are still preferred over the mid-and small-cap segments. Btw this does not imply that prices are, or will be, going up!! It only signals that large caps are the better place to hide at the moment.Growth vs Value Broken Down into Size SegmentsWhen we break down the Size segments into Growth and Value, things get more interesting.In the RRG above, you see the rotations for Growth and Value segments, broken down into the three size segments. And the resulting image is sending a very clear message. Large-cap growth stocks are leading the market. Again, be careful. This does not mean their prices are, or will be, going up. It only signals that this is currently the strongest segment in the market from a relative perspective.The Rotational Picture In Price TermsPlotting this universe of indices against $ONE gives an entirely different picture.All these tails are at a negative heading and inside or moving toward the lagging quadrant. This indicates that all segments in the market are going down in price. The only slight positive on this RRG is the $DJUSGL tail, which has started to curl up a little before closing in on the lagging quadrant.Finding Tradeable OpportunitiesNow, to find tradeable opportunities, I looked up all the members of the IVW ETF, iShares S&amp;P 500 Growth. You can find this information here. Then, save all the symbols in a ChartList for further processing. This list holds all the stocks that, according to S&amp;P Global, are considered ""Growth"" stocks. It is interesting to see plenty of stocks on the list from sectors not necessarily seen as ""Growth.""As the list holds&gt; 200 symbols, we need to do some cleaning to narrow it down to a more manageable number.Trimming the listAssuming we are looking for stocks going up in price, to begin with, so not necessarily ONLY looking for relative strength, I put the list in the scan engine. I added the requirements for stocks to be above their 5-day AND 20-day moving averages.This brings the list down to 23 stocks (around 11 am on Friday, 10/20). Adding the requirement that the 5-day MA be above the 20-day MA trims the list to 18 stocks.Here is the RRG for that group.Given my requirements for the scan, it is no surprise that all those tails are pointing northeast on the daily RRG. Another interesting observation is that there are no Technology or Communication Services stocks on this list. At the same time, these sectors show the strongest positive rotation on a sector level. Most names are in the so-called defensive sectors (Utilities, Health Care, Staples)...So while Large Cap Growth Stocks are leading the dance, it's primarily the ""growth"" stocks that are inside the ""defensive"" sectors...Get the weekly perspective.To get the longer-term perspective, I changed the RRG to weekly, which gives this image.A few symbols are getting less interesting as they are on a negative RRG-Heading.In the next pass, I disabled the tails that are not on a positive RRG-Heading (0-90 degrees)All of these stocks are worth a bit more research. Two Interesting StocksCombining the weekly RRG with the daily version at the top of the article puts NOC and LMT at the forefront. However, looking at their charts, we can see that both have already made a big jump, making them a bit riskier to chase as they already have had a big move up, not a good risk/reward profile.After going over the chart, I came up with two stocks that look interesting to me.McKesson - MCKThe first one is MCK. This stock is in a strong uptrend on the weekly chart, pushing to new all-time highs, while relative strength is also pushing to new highs, pushing both RRG-Lines above 100 and the RRG-tail deeper into the leading quadrant.This strong rotation is confirmed by the daily RRG-tail, positioned inside the weakening quadrant but heading back toward the leading quadrant.Corteva - CTVACTVA has been in a strong downtrend since the end of 2022, both on the relative and the price charts. However, these downtrends seem to be coming to an end now.On the price chart, CTVA has hit support around 48.50, potentially forming a double bottom. This formation will execute when resistance near 53.50 will be taken out. The next target will be the falling resistance line that marks the upper boundary of the falling channel in which CTVA still sits. Currently, that level lies near 55.From a relative perspective, CTVA is in a similar situation, although it looks as if the falling resistance has already been cleared. And the small double bottom is about to execute as well.Therefore, picking this up around current levels will likely put you in good shape from a relative perspective. The price chart is a bit more challenging, and depending on your level of aggressiveness or risk appetite, the execution of the double bottom, taking out the falling resistance, can be used as a trigger to enter.#StayAlert and have a great weekend, --Julius",stockcharts,2023-10-23 15:21:40.377325
"When the stock market turns to the downside, it's discouraging. But not all stocks go down with the market. Running daily scans can help you identify some gems. Here are three stocks that have hit all-time highs in a market struggling to decide which way to go. But just because a stock reaches an all-time high doesn't mean you should blindly buy it or think that since the stock has reached a high, it has no room to go further. You still need to have a strategic plan in place.Why Invest In Stocks That Reach All-Time Highs? Before diving into the three stocks, it's necessary to understand the benefits of capitalizing on stocks at all-time highs and the risks.  Legendary trader Jesse Livermore liked to find stocks at all-time highs because he thought there was a reason these stocks had gone high. There was enough buying interest to push the price higher. But will that momentum continue? That's where the challenge lies. Stocks that have reached all-time highs may experience a period of consolidation or even a price decline. And if the overall market trend is down, price can change quickly. So, if you decide to open a long position, you must have tight stops in place, just in case the momentum dwindles. How do you find stocks hitting all-time highs?The simplest way is to use the Sample Scan Library in StockCharts.com. Here's how to find it: Select the Charts &amp; Tools tab. Scroll down to Member Tools. In the Sample Scan Library select Browse Scan Library.The first scan on the list is the New All-Time Highs. Select the Run button and you'll get a list of all stocks and ETFs that meet the scan criteria. Let's dive into the three stocks that showed up on a scan of stocks that reached their all-time highs on October 18 and how they performed after hitting the high.Diamondback Energy (FANG)If you pull up a longer-term weekly chart of FANG—not to be confused with FAANG stocks—you'll see that the stock has been in an uptrend since 2020, although it went through a consolidation phase from the end of 2022, when the stock's price action went through a relatively shallow symmetrical triangle pattern. The stock broke out above the triangle pattern at the end of July. However, the breakout wasn't accompanied by a significant volume spike. There were some days with volume spikes after the breakout. Regardless, the stock has been trending higher along the support of its 21-day exponential moving average (EMA). For a couple of weeks (September 20 to October 6), FANG fell below the 21-day EMA (blue line) and its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) displayed by the red line. But FANG recovered and is not trading well above its 21-day EMA. CHART 1: FANG STOCK IS PULLING BACK. Look for price action at the first support level (pink dashed line). It could go lower toward its 21-day EMA (blue line). Keep an eye on the RSI (lower panel) for an increase in momentum during up moves. Chart source: StockChartsACP. For educational purposes.The stock hit its all-time high on October 12 and continues to rise. Keep an eye on the relative strength index (RSI), which indicates momentum. If the stock reverses and trends higher with a rising RSI, expect FANG to move higher.Progressive Corp. (PGR)Who doesn't know Flo? Progressive's ubiquitous upbeat commercials have etched the company's name in our brains. Perhaps the commercials are paying off. Progressive's stock has been trending higher for years, with higher highs and higher lows. Looking at the weekly chart of PGR (see below), it's clear the stock went through some pullbacks during the uptrend. In April 2020, PGR stock went below its 100-week SMA (green line) but recovered. More recently, in April 2023, there was another pullback to its 100-week SMA, which looks like a textbook classic. PGR bounced off the 100-week SMA by mid-July and has been trending higher.CHART 2: WEEKLY CHART OF PROGRESSIVE INSURANCE (PGR). Overall, the stock has been in an uptrend with a few pullbacks. The stock is now trending well above its 21-week EMA. Chart source: StockChartsACP. For educational purposes.The daily chart gives a more granular view. You can see that recently, the stock price gapped up and hit a new all-time high. It's now pulling back on low volume, indicating that the selling pressure isn't dominant. CHART 3: DAILY CHART OF PGR. The stock is pulling back on lower volume. Keep an eye out for a reversal and increase in volume. Chart source: StockChartsACP. For educational purposes.Murphy USA, Inc. (MUSA)Next time you shop for motor fuel at your local Walmart, you will find Murphy USA products on the shelves. It's not exactly the sexy company that makes it to mainstream media headlines, but the stock acts like one that deserves much more attention than it gets. As a side note, MUSA was mentioned in StockCharts TV. Our chief market strategist, David Keller, CMT, focused on the stock in a recent episode of The Final Bar. It made it to the top 10 stocks to watch in October.MUSA has had its share of pullbacks but has recovered from them. The daily stock chart of MUSA below shows that the stock pulled back in March but recovered.  There were some bumps along the way, especially the price action on August 3, when the stock went as low as its 100-day SMA and bounced back. The stock is trading well above its 21-day EMA and continues to rise, making new all-time highs. CHART 4: MURPHY USA KEEPS ON RISING. Keep an eye on the RSI (lower panel). A pullback could be an opportunity to accumulate some shares of MUSA. Chart source: StockChartsACP. For educational purposes.When To Make the TradeYou're probably thinking, well, if these stocks keep hitting new highs, won't they hit the brakes soon? They might, but they could also keep rising, especially when the high-flying big tech stocks are going through a volatile rotation. So, before acting, keep the following points in mind: Add charts of FANG, PGR, and MUSA (or any others filtered through your New All-Time Highs scan) to your StockCharts ChartLists. Keep an eye on momentum using an indicator such as the relative strength index (RSI). As long as RSI keeps moving higher and isn't at an extremely overbought level, there's a greater chance of the stock continuing to move higher. Looking at past price action in each of these stocks' charts, price pulls back and usually recovers, sometimes in a classic textbook way. Take advantage of those pullbacks and again watch the momentum. Add another confirming indicator, such as the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD), to the mix.  Take a quick look at the fundamentals using the Sector Summary tool in StockCharts. Know key factors such as earnings reports, revenue growth, and key fundamental ratios.  If everything lines up, the stock looks like it's recovering from a pullback, and you've identified an ideal entry point, know that anything can make a stock's price move against you. Know your exit points before hitting that buy button. Disclaimer: This blog is for educational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice.

"Sometimes, a stock's price can tip the market's hand leading up to an earnings report. You'll see a strong rally or decline anywhere from days to months before a company lays bare its books. But when you see a chart pattern that hints at indecision, such as a symmetrical triangle, you're likely in for a volatile move and a great upset, which can go either bullish or bearish.Such is the case of Tesla (TSLA) over the last quarter. And as you can see, the market's judgment favored the bears.CHART 1: TSLA STOCK BREAKS BELOW SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE. TSLA missed earnings expectations, which sent the stock price below the symmetrical triangle. Chart source: StockChartsACP.  For educational purposes.Let's back up, look at the bull and bear case, and take a closer look at the pattern itself, its statistical performance, and, most importantly, how you might have traded it.The Bull CaseLeading up to Q3 earnings, TSLA appeared to be on a roll. It outperformed its sector, Consumer Discretionary, and the S&amp;P 500 index ($SPX) year-to-date.TSLA was roughly 37% from its all-time high of $414.50, giving it room for growth. It's the most profitable manufacturer in the EV space, and a lot of hope was riding on the company's emerging Cybertruck production. So was the planned launch of its robo-taxi service in late 2024. Much was riding on TSLA's guidance as much as its earnings and revenue numbers. The Bear CaseThe bears' case against TSLA's Q3 performance was simple. Demand for big-ticket items slowed in Q3 amid a high inflation environment. Input cost compressed the company's margins, especially in the midst of its expansion plans. Plus, TSLA is facing increased competition in the EV space. Most importantly, TSLA's stock price, some argued, was still trading at a premium relative to other automakers. Overbought? Not technically, but fundamentally so, apparently.TSLA's Symmetrical Triangle Formation: A 34% Rise or 12% Fall?TSLA may have outperformed its sector and the broader market before its earnings report, but that changed quickly after the stock price fell (see relative strength against Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) and $SPX in the chart below). The Death Cross further muddied the waters. This is where you have to look more closely at the pattern itself.CHART 2: TSLA PERFORMANCE AGAINST S&amp;P 500 AND XLY.  Falling relative strength and the death cross are bearish signals. Chart source: StockChartsACP. For educational purposes.Symmetrical triangles or ""coil"" patterns are poor performers (according to Thomas Bulkowski's Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns). They indicate a consolidation phase. They can go either direction despite being considered ""continuation patterns."" (Toss a coin, anyone?). Their value, however, is that they provide a clear setup for bulls and bears. According to Bulkowski, symmetrical triangles result in the following:On average, symmetrical triangles rise 34% when they break upward and fall 12% when they break downward.Their success rate in reaching an upward target (using the formation height) is 58% on the upside but only 36% on the downside.BUT, symmetrical triangles also tend to reverse after a breakout 62% to 65% of the time, meaning you have to be flexible when trading this pattern.How To Trade TSLA's Symmetrical TriangleDepending on whether you were leaning bullish or bearish, you could use Bulkowski's historical average performance to set your targets: 34% to the upside or 12% to the downside.CHART 3: CALCULATING TSLA'S PRICE TARGET BASED ON MEASURED MOVE. According to the measured move of the symmetrical triangle, TSLA stock can fall as low as $163. Chart source: StockChartsACP. For educational purposes.Using statistical averages:A bullish trader might have calculated 34% of the breakout price, projecting it above the current level. Obviously, that did not pan out, as TSLA broke down.On the bear side, the breakdown took place at $250. The target, 12% below that price, would have given you a target of $220. It's a good idea to place a stop loss just above the breakdown level.Using a measured approach:To find the measure, first calculate the pattern's height by subtracting the lowest point from the highest point of the triangle (299.30 – 212.35). This gives you a height of 86.95.If the price breakout is upward, then you would add the height (86.95) to the price level of the breakout. Since no upward breakout took place, there's no target. However, the above graph includes where the upside target range might have been if TSLA had broken out toward the upside (red dashed line).Since TSLA broke downward at $250, you subtract $86.95 to project a downside target of $163.05 (rounded to $163.00). As you can see, it greatly differs from using the average decline target of 12% (which was reached).The Bottom LineTesla (TSLA) showcased an uncertain path leading up to its Q3 earnings. While the bullish outlook centered on its year-to-date performance, potential growth space, and dominance in the EV industry, the bearish perspective flagged concerns about the slowing demand in the face of inflation, compressed margins amidst expansion, and increasing competition. The symmetrical triangle pattern, known for its unpredictable behavior, further muddied the waters. However, this pattern offers clear setups for optimistic and skeptical investors. The aftermath witnessed a bearish descent for TSLA, reflecting the market's ultimate judgment and underscoring the importance of flexibility when trading in such patterns.Disclaimer: This blog is for educational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice.

"On September 7, 2023, I wrote about a ""fishhook"" structure formed in the Price Oscillator of the S&amp;P 500. A fishhook occurs when a Price Oscillator or Summation Index plot makes a temporary reversal attempt and restarts the prior trend. A fishhook represents a failure of the forces of reversal, and it opens the door to the prior trend, resuming itself with renewed vigor.The granddaddy was the fishhook structure formed in late September 1987, as featured in the chart above.When it rolled over again, the famous crash of October 19, 1987 followed. Fishhooks don't always lead to such big calamities, but the potential energy is there, which is why I get excited about them.As for the one I shared on September 7, here is how that one turned out (see chart below).We didn't see a crash after this August 2023 fishhook, but it did have the power to produce a lower low for the S&amp;P 500. And now the Price Oscillator has turned back up from a fairly low level, signaling that the bulls have the ball and the potential to run with it.Turning back to that 1987 episode, there is much more to that story that many younger investors didn't live through, so they do not remember. I got permission to share the following recollections from Art Cashin, who is the Director of Floor Trading at UBS and a frequent guest on CNBC:""On this day (+1) in 1987 (that's 36 years ago if you are burdened with a graduate degree), the NYSE had one of its most dramatic trading days in its 231-year history. It suffered its largest single day percentage loss (22%) and its largest one-day point loss up until that day (508 points). No one who was on the floor that day will ever forget it. While it was an unforgettable single day, there were months of events that went into its making.The first two-thirds of 1987 were nothing other than spectacular on Wall Street. From New Year to shortly before Labor Day, the Dow rallied a rather stunning 43%. Fear seemed to disappear. Junior traders laughed at their cautious elders and told each other to ""buy strength"" rather than sell it, as each rally leg was soon followed by another.One thing that also helped banish fear was a new process called ""portfolio insurance"". It involved use of the newly expanded S&amp;P futures. Somewhat counter-intuitively, it involved selling when prices turned down. The rally topped out about August 25 with the Dow hitting 2722. Interest rates had begun creeping up amid concerns of early signs of inflation. Treasury Secretary Baker began a rather open debate with the Germans on the relationship of the dollar and the Dmark. Soon the weakness in the market was turning into a visible correction. By the middle of October, the Dow fell to break an uptrend line that had protected it for over 1000 points. The flurry of takeovers and leveraged buyouts that had flourished all year began to dry up.On Wednesday, October 14, there were widely discussed rumors of a new punitive tax on takeover profits. Selling turned a bit ugly and the Dow fell 96 points by the close (a record point drop at the time). The next day there was no bounce and the Dow fell another 58 points.Friday, the 16th was an option expiration day. There was a very bad storm in London and that market closed, which forced more people to seek liquidity in New York. Stocks faced a steady wave of selling. As the close neared, rumors spread that the First Lady, Nancy Reagan, the President's right hand, might be admitted to the hospital with cancer. The selling intensified and the Dow closed down 108 points, on the low and a new record point drop.The weekend was a rumormonger's delight. Nancy was admitted to the hospital. Japan was considering a confiscatory 96% tax on real estate speculation. Germany proposed a change in taxes on some interest rates, which would make U.S. Treasuries unattractive to Germans. Rep. Gephardt was talking about a trade bill that would freeze imports. Treasury Secretary Baker went on a Sunday talk show and openly challenged the Germans on currency. There were even rumors of U.S. planes engaging Iran.At the time, I was running the floor for PaineWebber. Monday morning, I got up well before dawn and saw that Hong Kong was down about 10% and other markets were looking equally weak before their openings. I headed for the NYSE to check on our systems and staffing. I reached out asking the team to get in early. Once I had checked out the systems and verified staffing, I went with a partner up to the Luncheon Club for a quick coffee. With markets around the globe all down about 10%, I didn't know if we'd get to a coffee-dash or anything else after we opened.We sat about two tables away from a table where NYSE Chairman John Phelan sat with several directors and some staff. Every ten minutes or so, someone would rush up to Phelan and slip him a note or whisper in his ear. It was evident that things were deteriorating. As I headed for the floor, I went past Phelan's table, put my right arm across my chest and said, ""Morituri Te Salutamus Esse."" It was the gladiator's salute to the Emperor: ""We, who are about to die, salute you."" Phelan nodded without a smile.The opening was not an outright disaster, but that was primarily due to the fact that many stocks did not open immediately. They were delayed, with indications to warn investors of the prices that they might open at (with hopes of inviting bargain hunters). Meanwhile, in Chicago, where you could short without a plus-tick, prices headed for freefall. Soon prices were lower in Chicago than in New York. That brought even more selling pressure to New York.Shortly after the opening, as it became clear that this would be a very special and very dangerous day, several NYSE directors met in Chairman Phelan's office. They checked around the street to gauge any new trends in the selling pressure. They were also on the phone with the White House via former Senator Howard Baker, who was White House Chief of Staff.Meanwhile, back on the floor, the situation felt more unreal. Orders flowed in faster and faster, and the tape ran later and later. (The tape was linear, and the human eye can only recognize a certain number of symbols per second, 900 I think. To run faster than that would make the tape an unreadable blur. Traders can trade faster than the maximum reading speed, so the tape ran late.) One broker said it was like a bizarre dream sequence-nothing seemed real.In late morning there were signs that the markets might begin to stabilize. Then the newly appointed Chairman of the SEC, David Ruder, was intercepted by reporters leaving a meeting at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. Whatever they asked and whatever he said, it somehow was reported that the markets might have to be halted. Later, he would swear it was a typo, but you can't un-ring a bell. The fear of a halt sent buyers scurrying away. Stocks went into virtual freefall. The interaction with the futures saw prices melt away. The Dow closed down 508 points. One specialist, who made too good a market, ran out of funds and the firm was sold to Merrill Lynch that very night. At watering hole after watering hole, traders and specialists reported again and again how strained their resources were. Wall Street could not survive another day like this. Luckily, innkeepers, like Harry let them put the drinks on a tab.What is often lost in the retelling is that the next day, Tuesday, was far more dangerous. It was the day that the wheels almost did come off the locomotive. The Dow opened up about 200 points Tuesday to a round of cheers on the floor. But, stocks quickly turned lower. The 200-point gain was erased, and the Dow went negative, accompanied by an audible gasp on the floor. Soon it was nearing -100 and trading was being halted in several of the Blue Chips that make up the Dow.Then we learned that several key banks were shutting down the credit lines of market makers and NYSE specialists. The banks feared exposure to an apparently collapsing stock market.NYSE Chairman Phelan reached out to the recently appointed head of the Fed, Alan Greenspan. Unfortunately, Greenspan was on a plane. Desperate, Phelan called the President of the New York Fed, Gerry Corrigan. He sensed the danger immediately and began calling the banks to reopen the credit lines. They were reluctant but Corrigan ultimately cajoled them. The credit lines were reopened, and the halted stocks were reopened. Best of all, the market started to rally and closed higher on the day. It was an incredible time, and the financial system was within hours (and a few phone calls) of an absolute collapse. It was a time I'll never forget.After the crash, regulators added varying levels of circuit breakers and assured us they would prevent any repeat of the crash. Cynical traders likened the circuit breakers to lifeboats painted on the side of a ship. They were comforting and reassuring to look at but thoroughly useless in a real crisis. They were useless in the ""flash crash"" in May of 2010 and in the negative TARP vote selloff, and scores of other occasions. There is nothing more powerful than a free market that has changed its mind.There are a couple of other points worth noting for history's sake. The first is that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan had just been appointed on August 11, 1987, two weeks before the final price top that year. And on Sep. 4, 1987, he and the FOMC raised the Fed's Discount rate from 5.5% to 6.0% as a way for the new dog in town to mark his territory. It was the first such hike since 1984 and did not go over well.It is worth noting that because of the high volume of trading on Oct. 19, 1987, the Consolidated Tape System could not handle all of the price quotes, so the tape ran as much as 90 minutes behind real-time. So brokerage firms and investors around the country had no real idea what was happening on the trading floor unless they could get through to their representatives on the phone, and you can imagine how poorly that worked. Many traders sent in blind orders, with no idea at what price they would be executed, just because they were scared and wanted out, thus exacerbating the severity of the selloff.I was not a market participant in 1987. I was an Army captain then and a helicopter pilot, just freshly transferred to an installation near Frankfurt in what was then called ""West"" Germany. I learned about the crash while driving home on Autobahn 66 while listening to the news on Armed Forces Radio.My father, Sherman McClellan, was not yet in the newsletter business in 1987 (we started that together in 1995 after I got out of the Army). But Sherman did have some institutional clients he was advising at the time; he advised them in August 1987 that it was an ""important top."" It was a lower Summation Index top and a third top at that.After the crash, the great worry among investors was that the October 1987 crash was just like the October 1929 crash and it would lead us into a new Great Depression again. But by early 1988, it was clear to Sherman that something different was going on.The ability of the Summation Index to recover from the crash lows and push up to a nice high level told Sherman that it was not going to be a repeat of the 1929 scenario (and a continuation to the 1932 low), and he told that to his clients at the time. He also went on Gene Morgan's Charting The Market TV show on KWHY-TV, channel 22 in Los Angeles to tell Gene's viewers that it was not the start of another Great Depression and that the October and December 1987 lows should be firm. KWHY was the original ""Business Channel"" and it innovated a lot of the business news reporting features that are common today, including the scrolling ticker on the bottom of the TV screen.Unlike in 1929, when the Fed remained tight and Congress raised taxes, the Fed in 1987 threw money at the problem and told banks to keep lending and it worked. Greenspan was able to pull the market back up out of the crash that his new-in-office rate hike had helped to create, and rather than being criticized for having run the markets and the economy into a ditch, he was lauded for his expertise in pulling us all out of the ditch. As a result, Greenspan was rewarded with additional terms as Fed Chairman, serving until January 2006.",stockcharts,2023-10-23 15:21:40.378856

Watch risk gauges.""And here we are still stuck in time as time seemingly stands still amidst the increasingly faster speed and plethora of news.The SPY monthly chart is not bearish.It could turn out that way, but presently, SPY sits atop the blue line or 23-month moving average (MA).We have two weeks left in October, so we are watching the 418 level carefully.We are also carefully watching 450 as resistance.After all, a trading range is not only possible but also plausible.CHART 2: MONTHLY CHART OF ISHARES RUSSELL 2000 ETF.

"The Home Construction ETF (ITB) led the market the first seven months of the year, but fell on hard times the last two months and reversed its long-term uptrend. Today's report/video will look at the trend reversal in ITB using the RSI Trend Range indicator. We will then highlight a homebuilder with a confirmed Double Top and put forth a downside target. This bearish outlook jibes with our broad market analysis at Chart Trader. The first chart shows ITB with a head-and-shoulder top forming from late June to September. ITB broke support with a gap down on September 21st to confirm this pattern. The ETF continued lower into October and the big trend is down. Note that SPY is up around 2% in October, but ITB is down 2.79% and showing relative weakness. RSI(65,5) confirms the trend change with a move below 49 on September 27th. This indicator is the 5-day SMA of 65-day RSI. Long-term momentum turns bullish (uptrend) with a move above 51 and stays bullish until a move below 49. The recent move below 49 confirms the trend reversal on the chart and I am bearish on ITB. This indicator is part of the TIP Indictor Edge Plugin for StockCharts ACP.The next chart shows Toll Brothers (TOL) with a confirmed Double Top. The stock formed two highs in the 84 area (red arcs) and broke support at 75 on September 21st. TOL bounced in early October, but notice how broken support turned into first resistance (red line). The support break is holding and I view this as bearish. The blue shading marks the downside target in the 60 area. A close above 75 would warrant a re-evaluation. This week at Chart Trader we focused on SPY and QQQ as they bounce within bigger downtrends. Both are near resistance/reversal zones and we marked the key levels to watch going forward.

Gramps and Granny, woke up while Sister Semiconductors (SMH) fell.Transportation (IYT) tested the top end of the range we discussed, which is between 220–235.For XRT, we can say the range to watch is 57–65.Small Caps or IWM needs to hold 170 and clear overhead resistance at 180.Biotech (IBB) has been stuck in time for the last four weeks. The best range to watch would be 120–125.Prodigal Son Regional Banks (KRE), except for a couple of rallies and sell-offs, sits between 40–45.Bitcoin, a new member of the Family, was featured over the weekend in our Daily. As it holds 28,000, we anticipate it can climb to $31,500.And let's not forget commodities.In my recent interview with Kitco, I warned, ""Higher bond yields could already be taking their toll on the US economy, and weak economic growth and stubborn inflation continue to create a stagflationary environment, which would be bullish for gold.""In another recent Daily, we discussed DBA, the Agricultural ETF, and DBC, the commodity index ETF.""Over 21.80, we would begin to think more bullish in agriculturals. DBC on the right, more oil and precious metals focused, also underperforms the SPY. That is surprising and supports a risk-on environment.

"Waking up to a new week of geopolitical stress, fake news (Blackrock spot ETF), higher yields, softer dollar, equities rally, I thought to myself: As far as the market goes, it feels like time is standing still. Why would I think that? After all, it may not last and certainly we have opposing forces. Seasonally, Q4 should be strong. Bank earnings were solid with many more earnings on tap. Inflation remains sticky. Nobody knows if the Hamas-Israel war will escalate, lateralize, or resolve.Buyers defended the major moving averages in small caps and retail sectors. Our risk gauges are more neutral, not bearish or bullish. Thus there is no better time to go and review our Economic Modern Family on a weekly timeframe to help us assess if time has stopped, for how long and what is next.Top left, Granny Retail (XRT), since the rally in late July, has not done much. It's above 57, but below the major weekly moving averages; we could say the range to watch is 57-65 to alter time in perpetuity.Next is Gramps Russell 2000, Small Caps (IWM). Holding 170, IWM is stuck between major support and overhead resistance at 180. Even a move over 175 would be a good start to get things moving. And, clearly, a move under 170 would not be so healthy for time or investors.Biotech (IBB) has been stuck in time for the last 4 weeks. 120-125 is the best range to watch.Sister Semiconductors (SMH) is in a bull phase, is nonetheless stuck between 140-157. As a typical leader of the market, we're watching her carefully.Transportation (IYT) had a great rally from June until late August. But since then, it's sat at April, May, June lows, and now again at those same lows since late September. 220-235 a good range to watch.Prodigal Son Regional Banks (KRE) may need to be banished from the Family. Since March, the direction of regional banks is questionable, while big banks have the staying power.  Nonetheless, KRE, except for a couple of rallies and sell offs, sits between 40-45.Bitcoin, a new member of the Family, was featured over the weekend in our Daily.

"When Microsoft (MSFT) reported earnings last July, it topped earnings and revenue expectations yet got toppled by the company's guidance for the quarter reported today (Tuesday).Fears of a worsening economy were prompting organizations to reduce cloud service spending, and that's one of MSFT's biggest revenue drivers. In addition, MSFT laid off 10,000 employees at the start of the month. And for the first time since 2016, the company reduced its R&amp;D spending. The technicals, however, showed resilient long-term strength despite near-term weakness. And today's earnings smash was the turning point that validated the bullish outlook.MSFT Stock Price Shows Near-Term Weakness But Long-Term StrengthLet's look at the weekly and daily price action leading to today's earnings report.CHART 1: WEEKLY CHART OF MSFT STOCK. Note the near-term decline and the levels of support below current prices. Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.On a weekly scale, you can see that MSFT has been on a steady short-term decline since July, its last reporting period, giving two consecutive lower highs (see blue downtrend). However, MSFT prices have also tested and bounced off the historical support level of $311 twice, which shows that this support level has some resilience. Should MSFT break below $311, it would likely find support at $290.75 (pink dashed line). The Relative Strength Index (RSI), for now, shows momentum looking relatively bullish as it's rising over the 50 line. And prices are well above the 200-period simple moving average (red line), which provided critical support twice, in October 2022 and January of this year. Overall, the longer-term picture looks bullish. However, there's room for near-term weakness. Earnings in the next few quarters will determine the near-term outcome.Now, let's turn to a daily chart of MSFT stock and compare its performance against the S&amp;P and its sector (using XLK, Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, as a proxy).CHART 2: DAILY CHART OF MSFT. The stock is trading above its 200-day moving average despite showing a near-term decline. The Chaikin Money Flow indicator is showing signs of bullish momentum. Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.The daily chart for MSFT, much like its weekly counterpart, reveals that the stock is significantly above its upward-trending 200-day SMA. This suggests strong support if the stock's price dips in the short term. MSFT is outpacing the broader market ($SPX) by about 26% and the Tech sector by about 4.65%. This adds to its bullish stance somewhat. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) reveals early signs of bullish momentum. There's a noticeable bullish divergence between the stock's consecutive lower price points and increased buying pressure. Currently, with the CMF above zero, it indicates a trend where more investors are buying the stock than selling it off.Outcome: MSFT Stock Jumps After Hours as Earnings Stun Wall StreetMSFT's acrobatics are on full display as their net income skyrocketed by a whopping 27%. After two sluggish years, Azure's cloud revenue grew, growing at a clip that had analysts scrambling to adjust their expectations. Shares jumped 5% after hours. MSFT's EPS clocked in at $2.99 per share, topping the $2.65 consensus. Revenue bumped up 13% YoY. For bulls, $335 would have been a good entry point to go long (but with a deep stop loss at $311). If MSFT plunged on a miss, or if it falls back, then prices are likely to test $311, and the next support level, as mentioned earlier, is $290.75. Should a negative outcome materialize in the intermediate term, it would probably be a wise idea to wait until either level is retested before entering a long position on a bounce. The Bottom LineIn a market clouded by economic uncertainties, MSFT fired up its engines with a stellar earnings reveal. Despite corporate hiccups and global spending hesitations, Microsoft's stock resilience is unmistakable, outpacing its peers and proving it's not just a player in the big tech arena—it's setting the pace. The charts don't lie: near-term shadows can't dim the long-term luminescence of MSFT's bullish horizon. Still, it's important to watch this space, as even the brightest stars don't guarantee a continuous upward trajectory.Disclaimer: This blog is for educational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice.

"First off, we are heading out of town to New York where I will be visiting in studio several media channels and hosts.Then, we are off to Orlando for the MoneyShow.On November 1st, Keith and I go on vacation until the middle of the month.This is the last Daily I will be writing for a while.However, I will have several clips in the next few days to share, and Geoff Bysshe will occasionally write the Daily in my absence.That said, today, I began the day with the Benzinga Market Prep Show.I am featuring this today as content because I hope it helps you look at the market objectively.We did not discuss inflation, which, as you are aware, I believe can go hyper as geopolitical stress, social unrest, strikes for higher wages, and mother nature could each, or worse, all, kick into gear.We discussed bonds, small caps, commercial real estate, retail, and a couple of stocks.In that discussion, and on the heels of Bill Ackman's statements along with our technical indicators, we spell out the exact relationships to watch.Monday's Daily explained how much long bonds factor into the equity (and commodity) equation.We also cover small caps and the monthly charts, along with SPY, QQQ, Transports (IYT), and Retail (XRT).If the decades have taught me anything, it's that the simpler you can make the definitions, the better the comprehension.It is with that in mind that we show you how easy it will be in just a short time to see where this market heads next.Benzina Pre-Market PrepIn addition to the analysis, Joel and I talk about the floor days and how we figured out momentum with our senses!Plus, we go over a couple of picks.Thank you all for your continued readership and support.I hope you have many profitable weeks.Happy Trading.This is for educational purposes only.

"Big tech earnings week kicks off with Google parent Alphabet, Inc. (GOOGL) reporting on Tuesday after the close. More recently, the AI boom has been the biggest driver of the stock market, so that could be the main focus, as the big tech companies report. GOOGL has invested significantly into AI and will likely make it central to their search capabilities. Investors will be listening to how the company's investments could pay off.When GOOGL opens its books on Tuesday after the market close, investors will be closely listening for guidance, especially in the AI front. Analysts expect EPS of $1.45  and revenues of $75.94 billion. A lot is riding on GOOGL's earnings report, and the results could push the stock price in either direction. A positive earnings report could send GOOGL's stock price close to or above its all-time high. If earnings miss expectations, the stock price could see a significant fall. GOOGL Price Chart: A Weekly Perspective Google's stock price has been trending higher in 2023 and is trading pretty close to its 52-week high. The Distance To 52-Week High is at 1.41%. When you look at the weekly chart of GOOGL stock, it's clear that it was in a strong uptrend from April 2020 to November 2022. Since then, the stock went through a reversal and trended lower. But GOOGL has recovered from the downtrend and trended higher in 2023 (see chart below).CHART 1: WEEKLY CHART OF GOOGL STOCK. Although the stock has been trending higher for 2023, its Q3 earnings report can have a significant impact on the price action of Google's stock. Chart source: StockChartsACP. For educational purposes.On the weekly chart, the 23.6% and 38.2% Fibonacci retracement levels coincide with the 21-week exponential moving average (EMA) and the 50-week simple moving average (SMA), respectively, critical support levels to watch.GOOGL Price Chart: Daily Price ActionSwitching to a daily chart of GOOGL (see chart below), you can see that GOOGL stock is holding support at the 50-day SMA. If earnings beat expectations and the company has a strong outlook on AI, the stock price could go higher.CHART 2: DAILY CHART OF GOOGL STOCK. The daily chart shows a high SCTR score and a rising RSI. Both indicate strength in the stock. Let's see if GOOGL's Q3 earnings report sends this stock higher. Chart source: StockChartsACP. For educational purposes.The daily chart is showing strength. The stock bounced off its 50-day SMA and is trading above its 21-day EMA. The StockCharts Technical Rank (SCTR) is registering at around 95, which indicates the stock is strong. The relative strength index (RSI) is around 56, which suggests the stock has upside room if earnings are strong. Google's stock price today is trading higher, but investors are probably waiting to hear what the company says in their earnings conference call before buying more shares. If earnings beat and guidance is positive, and the stock trends higher, look for a close above the October 12 high of $141.22. This would be a higher high, a requirement to seal the uptrend. If, on the other hand, GOOGL reports disappointing earnings, the stock price could fall significantly. A drop below the September 26 of $127.22 would bring the stock price to a lower low, which would be an indication of a downtrend.Take a deep breath and wait for the 4:00 PM showdown. After-hours trading action should be interesting.Disclaimer: This blog is for educational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice.

"Monday, after a lot of spooky headlines, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) touched its 23-month moving average (MA) or the two-year biz cycle breakout point right around 417.Plus, the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) flashed green as did IWM, the small caps.The big question is, can IWM close out October above 170?If not, any rally will be short-lived.Today was an interesting day.SPY also cleared back over the 200-day MA, which if held, could mean more relief rally.But, TLT is reversing as well, so what we don't want is for the long bonds to outperform SPY.Why? That would be risk-off and recessionary. It would embolden the already bold commodities to run, especially with the dollar falling.Which we see as #stagflation.From a technical standpoint, yes, this is a mean reversion.However, if you look back to July, it is the 5th oversold rally in TLT.Sustainable?The biggest fundamental dynamic is that inflation can go hyperbolic (it already is in certain soft commodities because of the geopolitical soup).And, if the Fed relaxes now, one must wonder if they will be caught from behind again.Nonetheless, for us, the most important aspect of this is how TLT performs against the SPY and how HYG (junk bonds) perform against the TLT.Bulls want TLT to underperform both.Note the ellipses and text on the chart of TLT or the 20+ Year long bonds.Back in March, when we had the bank crisis flash crash, bonds signaled a flight to safety by outperforming the SPY starting March 7.At the same time, the price was around 101.Real Motion showed a bullish momentum divergence as TLT crossed over the 50-DMA long before the price did.SPY crashed, and TLTs rallied to 109.10 in a matter of days.Fast forward to today, TLT remains slightly underperforming the SPY.The momentum indicator shows a mean reversion but not a bullish divergence.Should TLT do what it did in March, that is, outperform the SPY, take that as a warning.That is a sign of risk-off, and perhaps a harbinger of an oncoming recession; or worse, stagflation.Let's not freak out yet though.It is always good to plan ahead yet act on price accordingly.This is for educational purposes only.

"I've been looking for the market to bottom for several weeks. But the trading environment has shifted to a new gear; a cautionary one.  On the other hand, this sudden shift in sentiment may signal that a climactic selloff, often a prelude to a new uptrend, may be close at hand. Fingers crossed.Markets correct in two ways: via falling prices or through time via lengthy and painful consolidations. The current market had been in a time correction until last week when the bearish interest environment and the rising hostilities in the Middle East pushed bullish and neutral traders over to the bearish side.You can see this happening in the market's breadth (more on that below), and in the dearth of sectors that are in uptrends. An even more cautionary sign is the Cboe Volatility Index ($VIX) crossing above 20, a sign that bearish sentiment is rising to new levels.As a result, it makes sense to focus on cash, build a shopping list, and look well off the beaten path for stocks in areas of the market that may still provide some upside even as interest rates choke off much of everything else.Subscribers to Joe Duarte in the Money Options have been well positioned for this market via these five time-tested steps:Raising cash via positions that hit sell stops;Hedging of portfolios;Keeping position size small;Looking for relative strength in offbeat areas of the market andBuild a shopping list for when conditions improve.Energy Has the Momentum, For NowThe energy sector remains a bright light in an otherwise dimming market. This is especially evident in large-cap oil, oil exploration and production, and natural gas stocks. The two representative ETFs that illustrate this point best are the iShares Oil &amp; Gas Exploration &amp; Production ETF (IEO) and the First Trust Natural Gas ETF (FCG).Both price charts are intuitively bullish, given their current uptrends, their trading near their recent highs, and the bullish rise in both Accumulation/Distribution (ADI) and On Balance Volume (OBV). Moreover, seasonal tendencies, as winter approaches and the rapidly evolving developments in the Middle East support higher prices in crude oil. In addition, disruptions in the oil supply resulting from the Israel-Palestinian conflict could lead to more money moving into natural gas companies as the liquified natural gas (LNG) market heats up again.On the other hand, if these strong sectors roll over, it would signal that a full-blown market correction is unfolding.I recently posted two new energy stock trades at JoeDuarteintheMoneyOptions.com. Have a look with a Free Trial here.Off The Radar Interesting StuffSometimes, it pays to look well beyond the mainstream, especially during geopolitical stress. Global commerce isn't going anywhere despite the macro trend of relocating factories and supply chains to friendly neighbors (friend-shoring/near-shoring). That's because some universal commodities are grown in specific parts of the world and not others—think coffee, cocoa, and yes, oil and natural gas.That brings the global shipping industry to the forefront. The mainstream view, which leaders in the shipping industry support, is that times are about to get worse for the sector. Many in the industry are forecasting a global recession as they moan about falling contract rates and rising costs.Yet a look at the SonicShares Global Shipping ETF (BOAT) shows that investors have been putting money to work in the sector. Granted, it's a niche play and a small ETF with only $20 million in assets while trading in very low volumes. Moreover, it's important to note that the stocks in this ETF are not household words and that sellers may gain the upper hand if the market climate fully sours.For example, the ETF's biggest holding is Japanese shipper Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd, which is not US traded. The only US-based company in its top holdings is Honolulu-based Matson Inc. (MATX), whose shares have had a decent run over the last few months and have recently entered a consolidation pattern.Certainly, even as its stock has done well, MATX is not without risk as the company provides shipping and logistics along the Trans-Pacific sector and services to Hawaii, Alaska, and Guam. The most recent earnings report beat expectations but also sounded a cautionary note, focusing on the economic risks of an economic downturn in the U.S. and other potential problems involving the Chinese economy.The flip side is that shipping costs will rise if a protracted war further disrupts the global supply chains and that companies like Matson will have pricing power.My point in highlighting BOAT and Matson is not to recommend their shares but to illustrate the lengths investors may have to go to, especially the allowances to risk that may be required to uncover sectors and companies which may be worth considering in the current times.Join the smart money at JoeDuarteintheMoneyOptions.com.

Unfortunately,  looks as if we're heading for a test of the March lows as the May support level has given way.  A break below the March and May bottoms, as highlighted by the trend lines on the chart, would be doubly bearish.  On the other hand, any further weakness in NYAD would lead to an oversold reading in the RSI (circled area), which could be the final washout of this correction.The Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX) broke below its 50-day moving average decisively and is testing the bottom of a major VBP support level (marked by the trend line).  ADI and OBV both turned lower as selling pressure built. Again, as with SPX below, RSI is nearly oversold.The S&amp;P 500 (SPX) fell below its 200-day moving average and entered an important support level of 4150 and 4250 (highlighted by trend lines based on VBP bars).  ADI and OBV turned lower, signaling rising selling pressure.VIX Crosses Above 20, Signaling Rising Fear  The VIX has finally crossed above the important 20 level, which has kept the bears in check up to now.  If this is not reversed, it will likely cause more trouble in the next few days to weeks.When the VIX rises, stocks tend to fall as its rise signifies that traders are buying large volumes of put options.  Rising put option volume from fearful traders leads market makers to sell stock index futures to hedge their put sales to the public.  A fall in VIX is bullish as it means less put option buying, and it eventually leads to call buying, which causes market makers to hedge by buying stock index futures, raising the odds of higher stock prices.To get the latest information on options trading, check out Options Trading for Dummies, now in its 4th Edition—Get Your Copy Now!

"Over the past six trading days, NVDA has fallen from a high of 476.09 to Friday's low of 410.78.  That's a drop of 65.31, or nearly 14%, in just over one week.  Would it make sense to take advantage of this selling?  Well, like any other stock, NVDA is subject to overall market headwinds or tailwinds.  Currently, there are plenty of headwinds and there are also reasons to believe these headwinds will persist in the very near-term.  I discussed the current environment in an article I published earlier today, ""Odds Favor Further Selling This Week (Maybe a LOT of it)"".  Be sure to check it out.  Part of trading and/or investing success boils down to preparation.  For those interested in NVDA, check out its 20-year seasonality chart from 2003 to 2022:Do you notice that the probability of monthly gains spikes in the second month of each calendar quarter - February, May, August, and November?  Those are the four most likely calendar months that we'll see gains in NVDA.  And how about those average monthly returns?  To summarize, here's how the average returns break down by calendar quarter months:1st month of calendar quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct):  +2.5%2nd month of calendar quarter (Feb, May, Aug, Nov):  +30.1%3rd month of calendar quarter (Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec):  +5.5%NVDA has been a tremendous performer, actually one of the best-performing stocks of this century.  But did you know that the second calendar month of each calendar quarter is responsible for most of those gains?  There's one reason for this bullish timing on NVDA - earnings!  NVDA typically reports earnings in February, May, August, and November.  And earnings drive prices.  There's a TON of NVDA accumulation (by big Wall Street firms) heading into earnings each quarter.  That's why we see those crazy returns when we compare the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd months of calendar quarters.  Knowing this type of information can be a real game changer for traders, wouldn't you agree?  Don't you feel like your odds of winning trades on NVDA just improved?I'm a stock market history buff.

"I've been watching the Volatility Index ($VIX) for years and it provides us a number of very important signals.  One of those signals is BE CAREFUL when the VIX moves from the teens and into the 20s.  In my experience, moving from 13 to 15 isn't the same as moving from 19 to 21.  We saw the latter last week and, if history is any guide, we need to be very cautious as we approaching this week.History of VIX Moving Above 20We've had plenty of bouts with fear rising, even during the past 10-11 years of secular bull market action.  Yes, I believe we remain solidly in a secular bull market.  I've said it repeatedly, because that's what I believe and what I see in my longer-term signals.  You may not agree with me, and that's fine, but I do have conviction.  Without conviction of the Big Picture, the market's ups and downs will make investing/trading emotionally exhausting.  ""We're in a bull market!  No, now we're in a bear market!""  One day, the sky is falling.  The next day, we have glorious sunshine.  How do you cope with it?  Well, it's having a solid grasp of how the stock market works.  Fear comes and goes and it's measured in multiple ways.  Today, let's focus on the VIX.  The escalation of fear is what drives very rapid acceleration in selling.  If you study history, you'll see that every significant selloff this century has coincided with a VIX reading that soars above 20.  But not every move above 20 results in a major selloff.  Not only do we need to be aware when the VIX moves through 20, but we also need to realize that we're at a very important juncture short-term.  In my opinion, the current secular bull market began on April 10, 2013, when the S&amp;P 500 cleared previous price tops in 2000 and 2007.  Here's the chart that validates what I believe was the start of the current secular bull market:The red-shaded area represents the last secular bear market, where we literally had no new highs on the S&amp;P 500 for 13 years.  I believe it's rather obvious to see that we're now in an uptrend, despite several major bumps in the road.  Since that 2013 breakout, I count 36 times that the VIX has broken from the teens to above 20, signaling rising fear that we need to be aware of.  Of the prior 35 occurrences, 23 resulted in almost immediate bottoms.  That is, in roughly 2 out of 3 occurrences, the VIX trip above 20 marked a significant bottom.  Let me provide you several 2019 examples in the following chart:The VIX trips above 20 didn't last and, essentially, that initial close above 20 marked the S&amp;P 500 bottom.  But, in approximately one-third of these jumps through 20, the VIX signals us something more serious in the near-term.  Here's an S&amp;P 500 chart since the trade war days of Q4 2018, highlighting the more serious VIX warnings above 20:These examples were much more serious and selling escalated rapidly.  Avoiding that short-term carnage would make a huge difference in a trader's account.  By the way, keep in mind that the current secular bull market has withstood all 35 prior occurrences.  On Thursday and Friday of last week, the VIX jumped to close back above 20.  But is this latest spike in fear going to result like 23 of the prior such jumps and mark the bottom now?  Or will the fear continue to escalate and send prices lower rapidly?  Well, there are no guarantees, but I believe it's prudent to believe that the odds of prices tanking this week, at least for a couple days, is stronger than 33%.I have two reasons that support this notion of lower prices in the week ahead.Bearish Technical Price ActionWe only need to look at the S&amp;P 500 daily chart to see the technical issues present at Friday's close:The VIX breaking above 20 is a warning sign, but I believe it's more important that the S&amp;P 500 closed on its low on Friday on increasing volume.  This is NOT capitulation.  In fact, it reeks of further selling ahead, until we see capitulation.  Selloffs can be MUCH more brutal when price support is lost with a VIX above 20.  So technical issues are telling me to be very careful.Historical BearishnessNext week is the absolute WORST week of the year historically, dating back to 1950 on the S&amp;P 500.  While the S&amp;P 500's average annual returns are approximately +9% over the past 73 years, check out the following annualized returns by calendar day on the S&amp;P 500 over those same 73 years:October 22nd (today):  -90.58%October 23rd (Monday):  -5.14%October 24th (Tuesday):  -32.64%October 25th (Wednesday):  -36.65%October 26th (Thursday):  -56.01%October 27th (Friday):  -24.27%Those numbers are a far cry from the S&amp;P 500's average annual return of +9%.And if you think things are better historically on the NASDAQ, think again.  Here are the annualized returns by calendar day on the NASDAQ since 1971:October 22nd (today):  -58.57%October 23rd (Monday):  -46.02%October 24th (Tuesday):  -64.64%October 25th (Wednesday):  -25.00%October 26th (Thursday):  -106.39%October 27th (Friday):  -78.14%Now I'm not providing any guarantees about price action next week.  Rather, I'm talking about tendencies and probabilities.  The VIX is screaming at us to be very careful, price action is suggesting lower prices ahead, and history shows very bearish tendencies in the week ahead.  Personally, I do not ignore those warning signs.The Silver LiningThe primary silver lining for me is that every important signal I follow says this weakness will be short-lived and that the current secular bull market will return stronger than ever.  The track record of these signals has been very strong for a decade.  The other silver lining, however, is that historical tendencies will soon flip to the side of the bulls.

"The markets wore a largely corrective undertone throughout the past five sessions; it oscillated within a similar range as the previous week and closed on a negative note. The volatility remained on the lower side; as the volatility has been low, the bands contracted as well. As compared to the 362-point trading range in the week before this one, this time, the Nifty oscillated in a 337.40-point range before closing towards its lower end. While continuing to defend key support levels, the headline index closed with a net loss of 208.40 points (-1.06%) on a weekly basis.From a technical perspective, there are a few important things that one needs to keep in mind. The Nifty has again closed very near to the 20-week MA which is currently placed at 19437. This makes the level of 19400 the most important near-term support for the Nifty on a closing basis. Any violation of this point on a closing basis will take the index to its original breakout zone of 18900-19000 levels. The volatility, as represented by INDIA Vix, also remains at one of its lowest levels. The INDIAVIX rose marginally by 1.88% to 10.82 on a weekly note. This technical structure keeps the market vulnerable to profit-taking bouts from the current levels.The coming week is a truncated week once again with Tuesday being a trading holiday on the account of Dussehra. We also have monthly derivatives expiry slated to come up later in the week. A soft start to the week is expected on Monday; the levels of 19650 and 19800 are expected to act as resistance points. The supports are likely to come in at 19400 and 19330 levels.The weekly RSI is 57.58; it has marked a new 14-period low which is bearish. The RSI also shows a bearish divergence against the price. The weekly MACD is bearish and trades below its signal line.The pattern analysis of the weekly chart indicates that the markets will have their upside capped and they have also dragged their resistance points lower from 20000 to 19800 levels. All technical rebounds will find resistance at this point. Further to this, the index has also closed very near to the 20-week MA currently placed at 19437. So, in the event of any extended corrective move, the index is expected to seek support at this point, i.e., the 20-week MA. If this gets violated, it will invite incremental weakness.All in all, unless rollover and expiry-centric moves cause technical rebounds, the markets are likely to largely exhibit a continued corrective undertone. There are possibilities that defensive pockets shall do well; it would be wise to stay invested in defensive and low-beta pockets. Besides being highly stock-specific, exposures should be kept limited to those stocks that show strong relative strength against the broader markets. While cutting down on excessively leveraged positions, all up-moves, if and when they occur, should be used to protect profits. A cautious outlook is advised for the day.Sector Analysis for the coming weekIn our look at Relative Rotation Graphs®, we compared various sectors against CNX500 (NIFTY 500 Index), which represents over 95% of the free float market cap of all the stocks listed.Relative Rotation Graphs (RRG) indicate that the Nifty IT, Energy, Midcap 100, Media, PSU Bank, PSE, Metal, and Infrastructure indices are inside the leading quadrant and are expected to relatively outperform the broader markets. However, some slowdown in their performance can also be expected because barring the Infrastructure and the PSE Index, all other groups are paring their relative momentum against the broader markets.Nifty Realty, Pharma, and Auto Index are inside the weakening quadrant. Except for the Pharma index, the other two are showing strong improvement in their relative momentum against the broader markets.The FMCG, Consumption, Financial Services, and Banknifty are inside the lagging quadrant. However, all these groups are improving their relative momentum as appears from the trajectory of the tail.The Services Sector and the Commodities Index are inside the improving quadrant.Important Note: RRG™ charts show the relative strength and momentum of a group of stocks. In the above Chart, they show relative performance against NIFTY500 Index (Broader Markets) and should not be used directly as buy or sell signals.  Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA Consulting Technical Analyst www.EquityResearch.asia | www.ChartWizard.ae ",stockcharts,2023-10-25 12:12:56.449505

"Most of you know our Big View product since I often discuss our risk gauges.I can report to you that our risk gauges show three out of the five with risk off.Most interestingly, the SPY continues to outperform the long bonds, risk-on.And junk bonds continue to outperform long bonds, risk on.You can read more about it on Sunday when Donn and Keith publish their Market Outlook.Another part of Big View is Sector Views. This part shows you the Economic Modern Family in their individual components.In the Daily, I have focused mainly on small caps and retail.Now, I want to show you three of the ""kids"".Plus, since commodities are now on everyone's lips, I invite you to watch Your Daily Five segment I did Friday all about that.Back to the kids.Sister Semiconductors SMH has been making lower highs since the peak in July. She also trades below the July 6-month calendar range low.Furthermore, SMH now underperforms SPY and the momentum on Real Motion shows a bearish divergence as momentum is under the moving averages, which are in a bearish phase.This is a potential game-changer. Should Semi's break September lows, it could get ugly since so much money is in the chip and tech sectors. People love to keep the dollar cost average down. That makes me shudder.Big Brother Biotech IBB never really got going in 2023. IBB peaked in August 2021 post-covid.Biotech trades under its 80-month or six to seven-year business cycle as well. This breakdown is concerning and points to much weaker economic times ahead.And Regional Banks or my dear Prodigal Son?Well, he has one foot out the door. By that I mean, out of the Family.Here's why.When I created the Economic Modern Family, Regional Banks, and not big banks were included as a reliable way to assess the small urban and more rural communities' trends on borrowing money.A good sign for the economy is when Regional Banks do well and ""local"" folks are borrowing and successfully paying back loans to expand their lifestyles.I called the sector Prodigal Son after 2008 because of the bible story.  The Banking sector is often lavish, then contrite when it oversteps, costing Americans dollars. Since March 2023, during the ""bank crisis"", KRE and many of the companies in that ETF basket have done nothing price-wise.Broadening out the chart to March, since the decline, KRE has traded in a $10 range.Now, that is a lot better than breaking the March lows if one wants to look at it optimistically.Nonetheless, the trading range could be more a result of the rest of the market holding up or just a general lack of interest in this sector.Or it could be a speedbump before the eventual annihilation of Regional Banks.That would leave me with a new chapter of the Family-do we kill off or merely send away our Prodigal Son?And do we think KRE should be replaced with big banks or XLF?Here's where our newest member comes in—Crypto.But that's an article for another time.And, if you check out the Crypto Town Hall X Spaces below, you can hear some of our thoughts.This is for educational purposes only.

"Stock market action in the last few months reflects how quickly investor sentiment can change. Federal Reserve Chairman Powell's comments on Thursday implied that inflation is still high and the US economy continues to be strong. Although there's a high probability that interest rates will remain unchanged in the November meeting, it's unclear what the agenda will be for the December meeting. Powell's remarks didn't help the broader equity markets, which closed lower for the week on Friday. The daily chart of the S&amp;P 500 below shows that market breadth is also weakening in addition to the index battling with its 200-day simple moving average support. CHART 1: S&amp;P 500 TRENDING LOWER. The index closed below its 200-day moving average, and the percentage of stocks trading below their 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving averages are also trending lower. Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.The percentage of S&amp;P 500 stocks trading above their 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving averages are declining.  Bond Yields RiseThe higher-for-longer interest rate narrative helped long-dated bond yields. The 30-year US Treasury yield is around 5.1%, and the 10-year US Treasury is close to 5%. The higher yields are having an impact on the banking sector. The daily chart of the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) shows the ETF is getting close to its May levels, when the US regional banking crisis occurred. Big banks are feeling the pain as well. The SPDR S&amp;P Bank ETF (KBE) also displays a similar price action as KRE. CHART 2: REGIONAL BANKS FALL AS YIELDS RISE. Regional banks, as well as the big banks, have been feeling the pain of higher interest rates. Price levels are close to where they were in May when the regional bank fiasco occurred. Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.Bond spreads are showing some significant action. The 10-year/2-year bond spread (see chart below) is rising steeply and is at -0.16. The same can be said about the 10-year-3-month spread. The 30-year/3-year and 30-year/5-year spreads are also trending higher. The steepening yield curves support Chairman Powell's statements about the strong economy and high inflation. And this increases investor uncertainty. CHART 2: 10-YEAR/2-YEAR US TREASURY SPREAD. Long-dated bonds are up, which steepens the spread between the 10- and 2-year Treasury yields. Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.Interestingly, while interest rates are rising, gold prices have been rising, which is unusual. This indicates that investors are jittery about global events and are leaning toward risk-off sentiment. Check out the Dynamic Yield Curve on the StockCharts charting platform.Turning to VolatilityYou'd think the present uncertainties would send volatility through the roof. Yet, the Cboe Volatility Index ($VIX), considered to be a fear gauge, hasn't shown signs of outlandish panic. The VIX tends to move inversely to the S&amp;P 500. When the S&amp;P 500 falls, VIX rises, and when fear is extreme, the VIX spikes. Although the VIX hasn't been showing outlandish levels of fear, it has been trending higher since mid-September, which needs to be watched closely. CHART 3: CBOE VOLATILITY INDEX (VIX) WITH 30-DAY MOVING AVERAGE OVERLAY. Although the VIX isn't at ""panic levels"" it's rising and has moved above the complacent 20 level. Keep an eye on this. Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.We are in the midst of escalated geopolitical tensions, interest rates are rising, a speakerless House of Representative, and so on. And while uncertainty rises, we have a big earnings week coming up with some of the big tech stocks reporting.  There's a lot to look forward to next week. Fasten your seatbelts.

"The Relative Rotation Graph above could not be more clear. Large Caps are leading the dance at the moment.The rotations of the tails for Mid- and Small-cap stocks are rolling over and entering the lagging quadrant again. This means that they are embarking on a new leg lower in an already existing relative downtrend.The opposite goes for the Large Cap tail, which has just curled back up inside the weakening quadrant and is now heading back into the leading quadrant.Stacking the Three Size IndicesThis can also be seen very well by just eye-balling the charts when we plot all three indices under each other. From the lowest point in the large-cap chart, Large caps are still almost 8% higher than where they started at the end of April. Mid-caps and Small-Caps are pretty much unchanged at +0.2% and 0.1%.Measuring the decline from the highest point in the last week of July, Large caps are down 6.4%, while Mid-caps are down almost 10% and Small-caps almost 12%.So, despite the current weakness in all market segments, Large-caps are still preferred over the mid-and small-cap segments. Btw this does not imply that prices are, or will be, going up!! It only signals that large caps are the better place to hide at the moment.Growth vs Value Broken Down into Size SegmentsWhen we break down the Size segments into Growth and Value, things get more interesting.In the RRG above, you see the rotations for Growth and Value segments, broken down into the three size segments. And the resulting image is sending a very clear message. Large-cap growth stocks are leading the market. Again, be careful. This does not mean their prices are, or will be, going up. It only signals that this is currently the strongest segment in the market from a relative perspective.The Rotational Picture In Price TermsPlotting this universe of indices against $ONE gives an entirely different picture.All these tails are at a negative heading and inside or moving toward the lagging quadrant. This indicates that all segments in the market are going down in price. The only slight positive on this RRG is the $DJUSGL tail, which has started to curl up a little before closing in on the lagging quadrant.Finding Tradeable OpportunitiesNow, to find tradeable opportunities, I looked up all the members of the IVW ETF, iShares S&amp;P 500 Growth. You can find this information here. Then, save all the symbols in a ChartList for further processing. This list holds all the stocks that, according to S&amp;P Global, are considered ""Growth"" stocks. It is interesting to see plenty of stocks on the list from sectors not necessarily seen as ""Growth.""As the list holds&gt; 200 symbols, we need to do some cleaning to narrow it down to a more manageable number.Trimming the listAssuming we are looking for stocks going up in price, to begin with, so not necessarily ONLY looking for relative strength, I put the list in the scan engine. I added the requirements for stocks to be above their 5-day AND 20-day moving averages.This brings the list down to 23 stocks (around 11 am on Friday, 10/20). Adding the requirement that the 5-day MA be above the 20-day MA trims the list to 18 stocks.Here is the RRG for that group.Given my requirements for the scan, it is no surprise that all those tails are pointing northeast on the daily RRG. Another interesting observation is that there are no Technology or Communication Services stocks on this list. At the same time, these sectors show the strongest positive rotation on a sector level. Most names are in the so-called defensive sectors (Utilities, Health Care, Staples)...So while Large Cap Growth Stocks are leading the dance, it's primarily the ""growth"" stocks that are inside the ""defensive"" sectors...Get the weekly perspective.To get the longer-term perspective, I changed the RRG to weekly, which gives this image.A few symbols are getting less interesting as they are on a negative RRG-Heading.In the next pass, I disabled the tails that are not on a positive RRG-Heading (0-90 degrees)All of these stocks are worth a bit more research. Two Interesting StocksCombining the weekly RRG with the daily version at the top of the article puts NOC and LMT at the forefront. However, looking at their charts, we can see that both have already made a big jump, making them a bit riskier to chase as they already have had a big move up, not a good risk/reward profile.After going over the chart, I came up with two stocks that look interesting to me.McKesson - MCKThe first one is MCK. This stock is in a strong uptrend on the weekly chart, pushing to new all-time highs, while relative strength is also pushing to new highs, pushing both RRG-Lines above 100 and the RRG-tail deeper into the leading quadrant.This strong rotation is confirmed by the daily RRG-tail, positioned inside the weakening quadrant but heading back toward the leading quadrant.Corteva - CTVACTVA has been in a strong downtrend since the end of 2022, both on the relative and the price charts. However, these downtrends seem to be coming to an end now.On the price chart, CTVA has hit support around 48.50, potentially forming a double bottom. This formation will execute when resistance near 53.50 will be taken out. The next target will be the falling resistance line that marks the upper boundary of the falling channel in which CTVA still sits. Currently, that level lies near 55.From a relative perspective, CTVA is in a similar situation, although it looks as if the falling resistance has already been cleared. And the small double bottom is about to execute as well.Therefore, picking this up around current levels will likely put you in good shape from a relative perspective. The price chart is a bit more challenging, and depending on your level of aggressiveness or risk appetite, the execution of the double bottom, taking out the falling resistance, can be used as a trigger to enter.#StayAlert and have a great weekend, --Julius",stockcharts,2023-10-25 12:12:56.451594
"When the stock market turns to the downside, it's discouraging. But not all stocks go down with the market. Running daily scans can help you identify some gems. Here are three stocks that have hit all-time highs in a market struggling to decide which way to go. But just because a stock reaches an all-time high doesn't mean you should blindly buy it or think that since the stock has reached a high, it has no room to go further. You still need to have a strategic plan in place.Why Invest In Stocks That Reach All-Time Highs? Before diving into the three stocks, it's necessary to understand the benefits of capitalizing on stocks at all-time highs and the risks.  Legendary trader Jesse Livermore liked to find stocks at all-time highs because he thought there was a reason these stocks had gone high. There was enough buying interest to push the price higher. But will that momentum continue? That's where the challenge lies. Stocks that have reached all-time highs may experience a period of consolidation or even a price decline. And if the overall market trend is down, price can change quickly. So, if you decide to open a long position, you must have tight stops in place, just in case the momentum dwindles. How do you find stocks hitting all-time highs?The simplest way is to use the Sample Scan Library in StockCharts.com. Here's how to find it: Select the Charts &amp; Tools tab. Scroll down to Member Tools. In the Sample Scan Library select Browse Scan Library.The first scan on the list is the New All-Time Highs. Select the Run button and you'll get a list of all stocks and ETFs that meet the scan criteria. Let's dive into the three stocks that showed up on a scan of stocks that reached their all-time highs on October 18 and how they performed after hitting the high.Diamondback Energy (FANG)If you pull up a longer-term weekly chart of FANG—not to be confused with FAANG stocks—you'll see that the stock has been in an uptrend since 2020, although it went through a consolidation phase from the end of 2022, when the stock's price action went through a relatively shallow symmetrical triangle pattern. The stock broke out above the triangle pattern at the end of July. However, the breakout wasn't accompanied by a significant volume spike. There were some days with volume spikes after the breakout. Regardless, the stock has been trending higher along the support of its 21-day exponential moving average (EMA). For a couple of weeks (September 20 to October 6), FANG fell below the 21-day EMA (blue line) and its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) displayed by the red line. But FANG recovered and is not trading well above its 21-day EMA. CHART 1: FANG STOCK IS PULLING BACK. Look for price action at the first support level (pink dashed line). It could go lower toward its 21-day EMA (blue line). Keep an eye on the RSI (lower panel) for an increase in momentum during up moves. Chart source: StockChartsACP. For educational purposes.The stock hit its all-time high on October 12 and continues to rise. Keep an eye on the relative strength index (RSI), which indicates momentum. If the stock reverses and trends higher with a rising RSI, expect FANG to move higher.Progressive Corp. (PGR)Who doesn't know Flo? Progressive's ubiquitous upbeat commercials have etched the company's name in our brains. Perhaps the commercials are paying off. Progressive's stock has been trending higher for years, with higher highs and higher lows. Looking at the weekly chart of PGR (see below), it's clear the stock went through some pullbacks during the uptrend. In April 2020, PGR stock went below its 100-week SMA (green line) but recovered. More recently, in April 2023, there was another pullback to its 100-week SMA, which looks like a textbook classic. PGR bounced off the 100-week SMA by mid-July and has been trending higher.CHART 2: WEEKLY CHART OF PROGRESSIVE INSURANCE (PGR). Overall, the stock has been in an uptrend with a few pullbacks. The stock is now trending well above its 21-week EMA. Chart source: StockChartsACP. For educational purposes.The daily chart gives a more granular view. You can see that recently, the stock price gapped up and hit a new all-time high. It's now pulling back on low volume, indicating that the selling pressure isn't dominant. CHART 3: DAILY CHART OF PGR. The stock is pulling back on lower volume. Keep an eye out for a reversal and increase in volume. Chart source: StockChartsACP. For educational purposes.Murphy USA, Inc. (MUSA)Next time you shop for motor fuel at your local Walmart, you will find Murphy USA products on the shelves. It's not exactly the sexy company that makes it to mainstream media headlines, but the stock acts like one that deserves much more attention than it gets. As a side note, MUSA was mentioned in StockCharts TV. Our chief market strategist, David Keller, CMT, focused on the stock in a recent episode of The Final Bar. It made it to the top 10 stocks to watch in October.MUSA has had its share of pullbacks but has recovered from them. The daily stock chart of MUSA below shows that the stock pulled back in March but recovered.  There were some bumps along the way, especially the price action on August 3, when the stock went as low as its 100-day SMA and bounced back. The stock is trading well above its 21-day EMA and continues to rise, making new all-time highs. CHART 4: MURPHY USA KEEPS ON RISING. Keep an eye on the RSI (lower panel). A pullback could be an opportunity to accumulate some shares of MUSA. Chart source: StockChartsACP. For educational purposes.When To Make the TradeYou're probably thinking, well, if these stocks keep hitting new highs, won't they hit the brakes soon? They might, but they could also keep rising, especially when the high-flying big tech stocks are going through a volatile rotation. So, before acting, keep the following points in mind: Add charts of FANG, PGR, and MUSA (or any others filtered through your New All-Time Highs scan) to your StockCharts ChartLists. Keep an eye on momentum using an indicator such as the relative strength index (RSI). As long as RSI keeps moving higher and isn't at an extremely overbought level, there's a greater chance of the stock continuing to move higher. Looking at past price action in each of these stocks' charts, price pulls back and usually recovers, sometimes in a classic textbook way. Take advantage of those pullbacks and again watch the momentum. Add another confirming indicator, such as the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD), to the mix.  Take a quick look at the fundamentals using the Sector Summary tool in StockCharts. Know key factors such as earnings reports, revenue growth, and key fundamental ratios.  If everything lines up, the stock looks like it's recovering from a pullback, and you've identified an ideal entry point, know that anything can make a stock's price move against you. Know your exit points before hitting that buy button. Disclaimer: This blog is for educational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice.

"Sometimes, a stock's price can tip the market's hand leading up to an earnings report. You'll see a strong rally or decline anywhere from days to months before a company lays bare its books. But when you see a chart pattern that hints at indecision, such as a symmetrical triangle, you're likely in for a volatile move and a great upset, which can go either bullish or bearish.Such is the case of Tesla (TSLA) over the last quarter. And as you can see, the market's judgment favored the bears.CHART 1: TSLA STOCK BREAKS BELOW SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE. TSLA missed earnings expectations, which sent the stock price below the symmetrical triangle. Chart source: StockChartsACP.  For educational purposes.Let's back up, look at the bull and bear case, and take a closer look at the pattern itself, its statistical performance, and, most importantly, how you might have traded it.The Bull CaseLeading up to Q3 earnings, TSLA appeared to be on a roll. It outperformed its sector, Consumer Discretionary, and the S&amp;P 500 index ($SPX) year-to-date.TSLA was roughly 37% from its all-time high of $414.50, giving it room for growth. It's the most profitable manufacturer in the EV space, and a lot of hope was riding on the company's emerging Cybertruck production. So was the planned launch of its robo-taxi service in late 2024. Much was riding on TSLA's guidance as much as its earnings and revenue numbers. The Bear CaseThe bears' case against TSLA's Q3 performance was simple. Demand for big-ticket items slowed in Q3 amid a high inflation environment. Input cost compressed the company's margins, especially in the midst of its expansion plans. Plus, TSLA is facing increased competition in the EV space. Most importantly, TSLA's stock price, some argued, was still trading at a premium relative to other automakers. Overbought? Not technically, but fundamentally so, apparently.TSLA's Symmetrical Triangle Formation: A 34% Rise or 12% Fall?TSLA may have outperformed its sector and the broader market before its earnings report, but that changed quickly after the stock price fell (see relative strength against Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) and $SPX in the chart below). The Death Cross further muddied the waters. This is where you have to look more closely at the pattern itself.CHART 2: TSLA PERFORMANCE AGAINST S&amp;P 500 AND XLY.  Falling relative strength and the death cross are bearish signals. Chart source: StockChartsACP. For educational purposes.Symmetrical triangles or ""coil"" patterns are poor performers (according to Thomas Bulkowski's Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns). They indicate a consolidation phase. They can go either direction despite being considered ""continuation patterns."" (Toss a coin, anyone?). Their value, however, is that they provide a clear setup for bulls and bears. According to Bulkowski, symmetrical triangles result in the following:On average, symmetrical triangles rise 34% when they break upward and fall 12% when they break downward.Their success rate in reaching an upward target (using the formation height) is 58% on the upside but only 36% on the downside.BUT, symmetrical triangles also tend to reverse after a breakout 62% to 65% of the time, meaning you have to be flexible when trading this pattern.How To Trade TSLA's Symmetrical TriangleDepending on whether you were leaning bullish or bearish, you could use Bulkowski's historical average performance to set your targets: 34% to the upside or 12% to the downside.CHART 3: CALCULATING TSLA'S PRICE TARGET BASED ON MEASURED MOVE. According to the measured move of the symmetrical triangle, TSLA stock can fall as low as $163. Chart source: StockChartsACP. For educational purposes.Using statistical averages:A bullish trader might have calculated 34% of the breakout price, projecting it above the current level. Obviously, that did not pan out, as TSLA broke down.On the bear side, the breakdown took place at $250. The target, 12% below that price, would have given you a target of $220. It's a good idea to place a stop loss just above the breakdown level.Using a measured approach:To find the measure, first calculate the pattern's height by subtracting the lowest point from the highest point of the triangle (299.30 – 212.35). This gives you a height of 86.95.If the price breakout is upward, then you would add the height (86.95) to the price level of the breakout. Since no upward breakout took place, there's no target. However, the above graph includes where the upside target range might have been if TSLA had broken out toward the upside (red dashed line).Since TSLA broke downward at $250, you subtract $86.95 to project a downside target of $163.05 (rounded to $163.00). As you can see, it greatly differs from using the average decline target of 12% (which was reached).The Bottom LineTesla (TSLA) showcased an uncertain path leading up to its Q3 earnings. While the bullish outlook centered on its year-to-date performance, potential growth space, and dominance in the EV industry, the bearish perspective flagged concerns about the slowing demand in the face of inflation, compressed margins amidst expansion, and increasing competition. The symmetrical triangle pattern, known for its unpredictable behavior, further muddied the waters. However, this pattern offers clear setups for optimistic and skeptical investors. The aftermath witnessed a bearish descent for TSLA, reflecting the market's ultimate judgment and underscoring the importance of flexibility when trading in such patterns.Disclaimer: This blog is for educational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice.

"On September 7, 2023, I wrote about a ""fishhook"" structure formed in the Price Oscillator of the S&amp;P 500. A fishhook occurs when a Price Oscillator or Summation Index plot makes a temporary reversal attempt and restarts the prior trend. A fishhook represents a failure of the forces of reversal, and it opens the door to the prior trend, resuming itself with renewed vigor.The granddaddy was the fishhook structure formed in late September 1987, as featured in the chart above.When it rolled over again, the famous crash of October 19, 1987 followed. Fishhooks don't always lead to such big calamities, but the potential energy is there, which is why I get excited about them.As for the one I shared on September 7, here is how that one turned out (see chart below).We didn't see a crash after this August 2023 fishhook, but it did have the power to produce a lower low for the S&amp;P 500. And now the Price Oscillator has turned back up from a fairly low level, signaling that the bulls have the ball and the potential to run with it.Turning back to that 1987 episode, there is much more to that story that many younger investors didn't live through, so they do not remember. I got permission to share the following recollections from Art Cashin, who is the Director of Floor Trading at UBS and a frequent guest on CNBC:""On this day (+1) in 1987 (that's 36 years ago if you are burdened with a graduate degree), the NYSE had one of its most dramatic trading days in its 231-year history. It suffered its largest single day percentage loss (22%) and its largest one-day point loss up until that day (508 points). No one who was on the floor that day will ever forget it. While it was an unforgettable single day, there were months of events that went into its making.The first two-thirds of 1987 were nothing other than spectacular on Wall Street. From New Year to shortly before Labor Day, the Dow rallied a rather stunning 43%. Fear seemed to disappear. Junior traders laughed at their cautious elders and told each other to ""buy strength"" rather than sell it, as each rally leg was soon followed by another.One thing that also helped banish fear was a new process called ""portfolio insurance"". It involved use of the newly expanded S&amp;P futures. Somewhat counter-intuitively, it involved selling when prices turned down. The rally topped out about August 25 with the Dow hitting 2722. Interest rates had begun creeping up amid concerns of early signs of inflation. Treasury Secretary Baker began a rather open debate with the Germans on the relationship of the dollar and the Dmark. Soon the weakness in the market was turning into a visible correction. By the middle of October, the Dow fell to break an uptrend line that had protected it for over 1000 points. The flurry of takeovers and leveraged buyouts that had flourished all year began to dry up.On Wednesday, October 14, there were widely discussed rumors of a new punitive tax on takeover profits. Selling turned a bit ugly and the Dow fell 96 points by the close (a record point drop at the time). The next day there was no bounce and the Dow fell another 58 points.Friday, the 16th was an option expiration day. There was a very bad storm in London and that market closed, which forced more people to seek liquidity in New York. Stocks faced a steady wave of selling. As the close neared, rumors spread that the First Lady, Nancy Reagan, the President's right hand, might be admitted to the hospital with cancer. The selling intensified and the Dow closed down 108 points, on the low and a new record point drop.The weekend was a rumormonger's delight. Nancy was admitted to the hospital. Japan was considering a confiscatory 96% tax on real estate speculation. Germany proposed a change in taxes on some interest rates, which would make U.S. Treasuries unattractive to Germans. Rep. Gephardt was talking about a trade bill that would freeze imports. Treasury Secretary Baker went on a Sunday talk show and openly challenged the Germans on currency. There were even rumors of U.S. planes engaging Iran.At the time, I was running the floor for PaineWebber. Monday morning, I got up well before dawn and saw that Hong Kong was down about 10% and other markets were looking equally weak before their openings. I headed for the NYSE to check on our systems and staffing. I reached out asking the team to get in early. Once I had checked out the systems and verified staffing, I went with a partner up to the Luncheon Club for a quick coffee. With markets around the globe all down about 10%, I didn't know if we'd get to a coffee-dash or anything else after we opened.We sat about two tables away from a table where NYSE Chairman John Phelan sat with several directors and some staff. Every ten minutes or so, someone would rush up to Phelan and slip him a note or whisper in his ear. It was evident that things were deteriorating. As I headed for the floor, I went past Phelan's table, put my right arm across my chest and said, ""Morituri Te Salutamus Esse."" It was the gladiator's salute to the Emperor: ""We, who are about to die, salute you."" Phelan nodded without a smile.The opening was not an outright disaster, but that was primarily due to the fact that many stocks did not open immediately. They were delayed, with indications to warn investors of the prices that they might open at (with hopes of inviting bargain hunters). Meanwhile, in Chicago, where you could short without a plus-tick, prices headed for freefall. Soon prices were lower in Chicago than in New York. That brought even more selling pressure to New York.Shortly after the opening, as it became clear that this would be a very special and very dangerous day, several NYSE directors met in Chairman Phelan's office. They checked around the street to gauge any new trends in the selling pressure. They were also on the phone with the White House via former Senator Howard Baker, who was White House Chief of Staff.Meanwhile, back on the floor, the situation felt more unreal. Orders flowed in faster and faster, and the tape ran later and later. (The tape was linear, and the human eye can only recognize a certain number of symbols per second, 900 I think. To run faster than that would make the tape an unreadable blur. Traders can trade faster than the maximum reading speed, so the tape ran late.) One broker said it was like a bizarre dream sequence-nothing seemed real.In late morning there were signs that the markets might begin to stabilize. Then the newly appointed Chairman of the SEC, David Ruder, was intercepted by reporters leaving a meeting at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. Whatever they asked and whatever he said, it somehow was reported that the markets might have to be halted. Later, he would swear it was a typo, but you can't un-ring a bell. The fear of a halt sent buyers scurrying away. Stocks went into virtual freefall. The interaction with the futures saw prices melt away. The Dow closed down 508 points. One specialist, who made too good a market, ran out of funds and the firm was sold to Merrill Lynch that very night. At watering hole after watering hole, traders and specialists reported again and again how strained their resources were. Wall Street could not survive another day like this. Luckily, innkeepers, like Harry let them put the drinks on a tab.What is often lost in the retelling is that the next day, Tuesday, was far more dangerous. It was the day that the wheels almost did come off the locomotive. The Dow opened up about 200 points Tuesday to a round of cheers on the floor. But, stocks quickly turned lower. The 200-point gain was erased, and the Dow went negative, accompanied by an audible gasp on the floor. Soon it was nearing -100 and trading was being halted in several of the Blue Chips that make up the Dow.Then we learned that several key banks were shutting down the credit lines of market makers and NYSE specialists. The banks feared exposure to an apparently collapsing stock market.NYSE Chairman Phelan reached out to the recently appointed head of the Fed, Alan Greenspan. Unfortunately, Greenspan was on a plane. Desperate, Phelan called the President of the New York Fed, Gerry Corrigan. He sensed the danger immediately and began calling the banks to reopen the credit lines. They were reluctant but Corrigan ultimately cajoled them. The credit lines were reopened, and the halted stocks were reopened. Best of all, the market started to rally and closed higher on the day. It was an incredible time, and the financial system was within hours (and a few phone calls) of an absolute collapse. It was a time I'll never forget.After the crash, regulators added varying levels of circuit breakers and assured us they would prevent any repeat of the crash. Cynical traders likened the circuit breakers to lifeboats painted on the side of a ship. They were comforting and reassuring to look at but thoroughly useless in a real crisis. They were useless in the ""flash crash"" in May of 2010 and in the negative TARP vote selloff, and scores of other occasions. There is nothing more powerful than a free market that has changed its mind.There are a couple of other points worth noting for history's sake. The first is that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan had just been appointed on August 11, 1987, two weeks before the final price top that year. And on Sep. 4, 1987, he and the FOMC raised the Fed's Discount rate from 5.5% to 6.0% as a way for the new dog in town to mark his territory. It was the first such hike since 1984 and did not go over well.It is worth noting that because of the high volume of trading on Oct. 19, 1987, the Consolidated Tape System could not handle all of the price quotes, so the tape ran as much as 90 minutes behind real-time. So brokerage firms and investors around the country had no real idea what was happening on the trading floor unless they could get through to their representatives on the phone, and you can imagine how poorly that worked. Many traders sent in blind orders, with no idea at what price they would be executed, just because they were scared and wanted out, thus exacerbating the severity of the selloff.I was not a market participant in 1987. I was an Army captain then and a helicopter pilot, just freshly transferred to an installation near Frankfurt in what was then called ""West"" Germany. I learned about the crash while driving home on Autobahn 66 while listening to the news on Armed Forces Radio.My father, Sherman McClellan, was not yet in the newsletter business in 1987 (we started that together in 1995 after I got out of the Army). But Sherman did have some institutional clients he was advising at the time; he advised them in August 1987 that it was an ""important top."" It was a lower Summation Index top and a third top at that.After the crash, the great worry among investors was that the October 1987 crash was just like the October 1929 crash and it would lead us into a new Great Depression again. But by early 1988, it was clear to Sherman that something different was going on.The ability of the Summation Index to recover from the crash lows and push up to a nice high level told Sherman that it was not going to be a repeat of the 1929 scenario (and a continuation to the 1932 low), and he told that to his clients at the time. He also went on Gene Morgan's Charting The Market TV show on KWHY-TV, channel 22 in Los Angeles to tell Gene's viewers that it was not the start of another Great Depression and that the October and December 1987 lows should be firm. KWHY was the original ""Business Channel"" and it innovated a lot of the business news reporting features that are common today, including the scrolling ticker on the bottom of the TV screen.Unlike in 1929, when the Fed remained tight and Congress raised taxes, the Fed in 1987 threw money at the problem and told banks to keep lending and it worked. Greenspan was able to pull the market back up out of the crash that his new-in-office rate hike had helped to create, and rather than being criticized for having run the markets and the economy into a ditch, he was lauded for his expertise in pulling us all out of the ditch. As a result, Greenspan was rewarded with additional terms as Fed Chairman, serving until January 2006.",stockcharts,2023-10-25 12:12:56.453206

"The Home Construction ETF (ITB) led the market the first seven months of the year, but fell on hard times the last two months and reversed its long-term uptrend. Today's report/video will look at the trend reversal in ITB using the RSI Trend Range indicator. We will then highlight a homebuilder with a confirmed Double Top and put forth a downside target. This bearish outlook jibes with our broad market analysis at Chart Trader. The first chart shows ITB with a head-and-shoulder top forming from late June to September. ITB broke support with a gap down on September 21st to confirm this pattern. The ETF continued lower into October and the big trend is down. Note that SPY is up around 2% in October, but ITB is down 2.79% and showing relative weakness. RSI(65,5) confirms the trend change with a move below 49 on September 27th. This indicator is the 5-day SMA of 65-day RSI. Long-term momentum turns bullish (uptrend) with a move above 51 and stays bullish until a move below 49. The recent move below 49 confirms the trend reversal on the chart and I am bearish on ITB. This indicator is part of the TIP Indictor Edge Plugin for StockCharts ACP.The next chart shows Toll Brothers (TOL) with a confirmed Double Top. The stock formed two highs in the 84 area (red arcs) and broke support at 75 on September 21st. TOL bounced in early October, but notice how broken support turned into first resistance (red line). The support break is holding and I view this as bearish. The blue shading marks the downside target in the 60 area. A close above 75 would warrant a re-evaluation. This week at Chart Trader we focused on SPY and QQQ as they bounce within bigger downtrends. Both are near resistance/reversal zones and we marked the key levels to watch going forward.

Gramps and Granny, woke up while Sister Semiconductors (SMH) fell.Transportation (IYT) tested the top end of the range we discussed, which is between 220–235.For XRT, we can say the range to watch is 57–65.Small Caps or IWM needs to hold 170 and clear overhead resistance at 180.Biotech (IBB) has been stuck in time for the last four weeks. The best range to watch would be 120–125.Prodigal Son Regional Banks (KRE), except for a couple of rallies and sell-offs, sits between 40–45.Bitcoin, a new member of the Family, was featured over the weekend in our Daily. As it holds 28,000, we anticipate it can climb to $31,500.And let's not forget commodities.In my recent interview with Kitco, I warned, ""Higher bond yields could already be taking their toll on the US economy, and weak economic growth and stubborn inflation continue to create a stagflationary environment, which would be bullish for gold.""In another recent Daily, we discussed DBA, the Agricultural ETF, and DBC, the commodity index ETF.""Over 21.80, we would begin to think more bullish in agriculturals. DBC on the right, more oil and precious metals focused, also underperforms the SPY. That is surprising and supports a risk-on environment.
