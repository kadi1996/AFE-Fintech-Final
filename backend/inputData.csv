"The traditional year-end rally may have started with last week's liftoff on Wall Street, as the Fed's rate hikes start to bite and the economy shows signs of slowing. Investors hope the economy slows just enough to reduce inflation.The stock market seems to have bottomed, as short sellers panicked and recently frightened buyers rushed back into the markets. It's about time, as the signs of a pending reversal have been in place for the past two months, namely a slowing economy and fears about the Fed's rate hike cycle, which have been mounting as investor's pessimism rose to a fever pitch. Moreover, the self-perpetuating talk of doom loops led to a bout of panic selling, which reversed as the Fed held rates steady and Friday's employment report showed a cooling in the labor market.Of course, there are no certainties in any market. And this rally could easily fizzle. But the longer stocks hold up and bond yields remain subdued, the higher the odds of the rally intensifying.Buckle up! Santa may be warming up his sled.The Signs Were ThereI've been expecting a major reversal in both bonds and stocks since September when the selling in the U.S. Treasury market, and the subsequent rise in yields entered an absurd trading pattern. I chronicled the entire process, including the likelihood of a pending reversal in bond yields on October 15, 2023, when I wrote:""The slightly-hotter-than-predicted PPI and CPI numbers certainly put a temporary damper on the recent short-covering rally in stocks and bonds, raising investor fears about further interest rate increases. But, as I've noted recently, fear is often the prelude to a buying opportunity. Such an opportunity may be developing in the U.S. Treasury Bond market and related interest-sensitive sectors of the stock market, such as homebuilders, real estate investment trusts, and select technology stocks.""Prior to that, I had suggested that a historic buying opportunity in homebuilder stocks was approaching, while providing an actionable trading plan for such a development here.Last week, in this space, I wrote: ""The stock market is increasingly oversold, so investors should prepare for a potential bounce before the end of the year, especially given the usual bullish seasonality which begins in November and can run through January.""Bond Yields Crash and Burn and Stocks Respond with Bullish Reversal and Broad RallyWhat a difference a week makes, especially in the strange world of the U.S. Treasury bond market. Just two weeks ago, the U.S. Ten Year note yield (TNX) tagged 5%, a chart point which triggered heavy selling in stocks from the mechanical trading crowd, also known as commodity trading advisors (CTAs) and their hedge fund brethren. The selling was further enhanced by headlines about mortgage rates moving above 8%.But as I noted here, the selling spree had the smell of panic, especially given the lack of a new low in the RSI indicator, when the New York Stock Exchange Advance Decline line (NYAD), as I describe below, made a lower low. The key was whether NYAD broke below its March lows, which it didn't. This provided the perfect setup for a massive short squeeze, which is currently unfolding.Here are some details. The U.S. Ten Year Note yield has rolled over, with two significant technical developments occurring:TNX is now trading inside the upper Bollinger Band, which is two standard deviations above its 200-day moving average. This marks a return to a ""normal"" trading pattern;It is also testing its 50-day moving average and the 4.5% yield area. Normal trading action suggests that a consolidation in this area should occur before TNX makes a move toward 4.3%; andBullishly for the homebuilder and housing-related real estate stocks, as well as the rest of the market, mortgage rates seem to have topped out as well.Moreover, as I discuss below, the rally seems be quite broad, as measured by the New York Stock Exchange Advance Decline line. In addition, money is moving back into large-cap technology stocks, as in the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), which also rebounded above its 50-day moving average. Especially encouraging on this price chart is the rally in On Balance Volume (OBV), which signals that the rally is being fueled by real buying along with short-covering, as evidenced by a rising ADI line.Big tech certainly got a boost, as Microsoft (MSFT) continued its recent climb and is approaching a potential breakout which, if left unhindered, could well take the stock to the $400 area in the next few weeks.But it's not just big tech that's rising. A less obvious member of the QQQ stable, food producer and packager Mondelez (MDLZ), has been quietly moving higher and is now approaching its 200-day moving average. MDLZ's On Balance Volume (OBV) line is rising nicely as money piles into the shares.Huge Potential Gains Lurk in HomebuildersEven better is the unfolding rebound above the 200-day moving average in the SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF (XHB), where OBV is exhibiting an equally bullish trading pattern. As I noted above, I issued a Buy alert on the homebuilders a few weeks ago, and thus subscribers to my service have been well-positioned for this move in the sector.Consequently, the rally in the homebuilders may just be starting, especially if interest rates don't rise dramatically from current levels. As the price chart above shows, mortgage rates may have topped out, along with bond yields. This reversal is already being reflected in the bullish action visible in the homebuilder stocks. Note the following:Rates are still trading above normal long term trends. The upper purple line on the chart is two standard deviations above the 200-day moving average.Since mortgage rates follow the trend in TNX (above), the odds favor a further decline in mortgage rates, with the first downside target being 6.5%.Note the nearly perfect correlation between falling bond yields (TNX), falling mortgage rates, and rising homebuilder stocks (SPHB).Join the smart money at Joe Duarte in the Money Options.com. You can have a look at my latest recommendations FREE with a two-week trial subscription.

The price chart below shows the similarity between the unfolding market bottom and that which occurred in October 2022. The circled areas highlight this super cool technical phenomenon where the lack of a new low in the RSI, when NYAD made a new low, marked the bottom. Also note the double top in VIX, which is also repeated.The Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX) rallied above its 50-day moving average, with both ADI and OBV turning higher as short sellers cover (ADI) and buyers move in (OBV).The S&amp;P 500 (SPX) also rebounded above its 200-day moving average, returning to bullish territory after its recent dip below 4150.VIX is Back Below 20The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) didn't stay above the 20 level for long, which is a bullish development.When the VIX rises, stocks tend to fall, as rising put volume is a sign that market makers are selling stock index futures to hedge their put sales to the public. A fall in VIX is bullish, as it means less put option buying, and it eventually leads to call buying, which causes market makers to hedge by buying stock index futures. This raises the odds of higher stock prices.To get the latest information on options trading, check out Options Trading for Dummies, now in its 4th Edition—Get Your Copy Now!

"Last week's sharp upward reversal in the bond market followed the FOMC Interest Rate decision. A decision to not change the Fed Funds Interest Rate target. Unlike the prior meeting ‘non-action', this decision inspired robust bond and stock buying by the investment community. The downward stride of bond prices this year has been punishing to bond portfolio valuations. The regional bank crisis in the spring of this year dramatically illustrated the problem. Bond prices calmed into the beginning of summer, but trouble heated up again with the start of a new downward leg of the bond bear market. Was there a warning that a new downtrend was starting, and how far down could bond prices fall?For this trend study we turn to the iShares U.S. Treasury Bond 7-10 Year ETF (IEF). Treasuries rallied following the trouble in the banking sector in March. Essentially in the 2nd Quarter of '23 a new wave of Distribution formed preparing the way for a future downward trend for bond prices. In the month of June Distribution was nearly complete as demonstrated by a very flat price structure below key Support, with no ability for price to lift. Wyckoffians call this ICE when it develops following Distribution. The Supply Trendline established the likely pace of the emerging downward stride. Once a downtrend kicks off it must be respected for the force of nature it is. iShares U.S. Treasury Bond 7-10 Year ETF (IEF)Chart Notes:Following the Regional Banking trouble bonds try to rally.

The sharp sudden rally has good demand and short covering characteristics. Stock investors were bullishly inspired by the ripping reversal. The deep pessimism into recent lows for stocks and bonds is indicative of investors being positioned with high cash levels and short exposure. Fuel for a rally that appears to have kicked-off this past week. All the Best,Bruce@rdwyckoffReference to Wyckoff Distribution definitions: CLICK HERE Disclaimer: This blog is for educational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice. The ideas and strategies should never be used without first assessing your own personal and financial situation, or without consulting a financial professional.  AnnouncementJoin Roman Bogomazov and me each week on the Wyckoff Market Discussions where we take a deep dive into key markets from a Wyckoffian perspective.

"Trading isn't easy.  It requires knowledge, experience, patience, discipline, risk management, preparation, research, and sometimes just old-fashioned good luck!  After recognizing several cautious signals back in July, EarningsBeats.com suggested exercising patience to get us through whatever lied ahead.  Well, hindsight now tells us that it was a correction.  From high to low, here are how our major indices and sectors fared:Look at where the relative weakness was found throughout this correction.  3 of the bottom 4 sectors were defensive groups - XLP, XLRE, XLU.  These are ""safety"" sectors.  One aggressive sector  (XLC) outperformed all others.  Two others - XLF and XLK - were ""middle of the pack"".  This correction did NOT see a mass exodus away from aggressive stocks.  Before I go any further, let me show you the difference during the 2022 cyclical bear market.  Here's how our major indices and sectors performed from the start of this bear market in early-January 2022 through late-February 2022:Check out the bottom index and also the 3 bottom sectors.  Doesn't that tell us a little different story?  There was mass exodus OUT of key aggressive areas.  Why?  Because Wall Street had no interest in these groups and rotated away from them as the big firms saw further weakness ahead.  That same message does not apply to this correction and that's one big reason why I kept saying we were going to see a very strong Q4 once this selling ended.Could last week have sent a more powerful message?  Here's how our 11 sectors performed during that massive buying spree:So on the way down, the aggressive sectors held their own.  But on the first significant rally, our 5 aggressive sectors - XLK, XLY, XLC, XLI, XLF - were all in the top 6 sectors.  Only the ridiculously-oversold real estate sector beat these aggressive areas.  Again, the story that this relative price action is telling us is that the prior selling episode was temporary is now OVER!  It's just a matter of whether you prefer to listen to CNBC or the charts.  I'll take the latter, thank you very much.I wanted to give you the backdrop of the market environment the last 3 months - as I saw it.  There are plenty of other signals I use to call likely market direction, but relative performance is a big one.  Recently, I shared with members how difficult it's been for me to trade individual stocks since July.  I haven't traded a lot, but when I have, it usually ended poorly.  That changed in a big way this past week.  I stuck mostly with ETFs tracking the major indices, but I re-introduced leveraged ETFs to take full advantage of last week's surge.  Patience is key to maximizing returns and outperforming the benchmark S&amp;P 500.My best individual stock trade last week was easily NVIDIA Corp (NVDA).  There were 2 important developments that created an absolutely awesome trading opportunity.  The first one was the hammer candlestick that formed on Tuesday:A hammer with an intraday breakdown below key price support is powerful.  But perhaps even more powerful is NVDA's seasonality.  As most of you probably know, I'm a stock market historian and am well aware of seasonal patterns on our major indices.  Well recently, I decided to take it another step further and analyze key trends in many individual stocks.  What I found was AMAZING!  Perhaps the craziest stat I found on NVDA is that it LOVES its earnings months.  That sets it apart from most large cap stocks, because most large companies report quarterly results in the first month of each calendar quarter.  So the norm is to report during January, April, July, and October.  But NVDA is different and reports during the second month of every calendar quarter.  That means its earnings are released during February, May, August, and November (green-shaded areas above).  Of all the individual stocks that I analyzed, NVDA had the strongest average annual return at 59.83%.  That's amazing in itself, but listen to this.  NVDA's annualized return for its 4 earnings months are its 4 best of the year.  Check out these annualized returns:February:  +82.25%May:  +117.69%August:  +80.31%November:  +96.89%Sounds like 4 pretty decent months to own NVDA historically.  Knowing this information and then seeing that October 31st hammer at major price support and just before its historical November strength suggested an excellent time to enter this trade.  So I entered.  NVDA shot up nearly 50 bucks over the past three trading days.  That's the potential power when you combine (1) a bullish technical setup with (2) a bullish seasonal period.  There are also bullish tendencies for ALL stocks during the early part of calendar months.Listen, EVERY SINGLE TRADER should know basic historical tendencies regarding the monthly calendar.  It will help in your trading.  You'll also find these trading patterns to be simply amazing!

"There is growing speculation that the Securities and Exchanged Commission (SEC) of the U.S. federal government is close to approving one or more spot Bitcoin ETFs to begin trading. That speculation has driven up Bitcoin prices to the highest level in more than a year. It has also driven up total open interest in Bitcoin futures.Bitcoin has been around as a cryptocurrency since January 2009, but Bitcoin futures contracts have only been trading since December 2017. And they did not make an appearance in the CFTC's Commitment of Traders (COT) Report until April 2018. Adoption of trading Bitcoin futures has been gradual, and it is still a long way from matching the size of total open interest we see in the eMini S&amp;P 500 contract, for example, which recently had over 2 million contracts of open interest.The fascinating aspect of total open interest in Bitcoin is that, every once in a while, it sees a spike in a relatively short amount of time. When that happens, it nearly always marks a turning point for Bitcoin prices. It can be a top or a bottom.This is all relevant now because Bitcoin prices have been rushing higher recently, as traders speculate on that SEC approval happening soon. They had the same rush on speculation about the debut of BITO, the Bitcoin Futures ETF, and that spike marked the all-time high for Bitcoin prices. Other spikes have marked turning points of lesser importance, but it is a reliable indication.A spot Bitcoin ETF is a big deal because an ETF trading futures is inherently inefficient as an ""investment"", because of contango in the contract pricing, though it can be useful for trading. Here are futures prices as of Nov. 3, 2023:Nov23  34890 Dec23  35305 Jan24  35495 Feb24  35750 Mar24  35930 Apr24  35980An ETF which owns futures contracts will concentrate its ownership in the nearest month contracts because they are more liquid. As those contracts are nearing expiration, the ETF will be forced to ""roll"" to contracts further into the future. Since those contracts are priced higher than the near-month contract, the ETF loses out with every roll. An investor who sits in a Bitcoin futures ETF for very long is losing value every month versus spot Bitcoins. So if a spot Bitcoin ETF could ever get approved, that would open up a new way for average investors to own Bitcoin without having to worry about ""wallets"", or brokers who have not been around for very long.Speculators are rushing in ahead of that anticipated surge in demand, just as they rushed in ahead of BITO's approval only to see it top. The same dynamic occurred with gold when it was finally authorized public ownership in 1975. Late 1974 saw a big run up in worldwide gold prices as speculators in other countries tried to front-run the anticipated surge in demand once U.S. investors were finally going to be allowed to own gold. The initial demand never lived up to those expectations, and gold prices dropped from $186.80/oz in December 1974 all the way down to $110.10 by August 1976.The lesson here is that those who are chasing into Bitcoin now on speculation about the impending ETF approval are likely going to end up like those 1974 gold speculators, and like the earlier Bitcoin speculators who topped Bitcoin prices as they rushed in ahead of the debut of BITO.",stockcharts,2023-11-07 10:01:35.688719
"The S&amp;P 500 is battling the 200-day SMA with four crosses over the last eleven days. We are also seeing a rise in volatility as this market benchmark plunged 5.86% in nine days (18-27 October) and then surged 5.85% the last five days. With such conditions, it is a good time to step back and look for ways to filter the noise. Today's report will show a technique and quantify the signals with a back test. Read to the end for an offer to access the extended version of this report.The chart below shows the S&amp;P 500 with the 200-day SMA (red line) and the Percent above MA (1,200) indicator. This indicator shows the percentage difference between the close and the 200-day. It turns green when SPX crosses above the 200-day SMA and red when it crosses below. SPX crossed its 200-day SMA 195 times since January 2000. Anyone trading such a signal would experience lots of whipsaws and relatively small returns. As the table below shows, there were 93 trades since January 2000. This means there were over 180 crosses of the 200-day moving average. Buy-and-hold for the S&amp;P 500 generated a 4.66% Compound Annual Return with a 56.73% Maximum Drawdown. In contrast, trading the 200-day cross returned 3.65% with a Maximum Drawdown of 21.31%. This moving average cross strategy reduced the drawdown, but the whipsaws ate into the returns. Chartists can improve performance by adding a filter. The next image shows the Percent above MA indicator with a 3% filter. This means the S&amp;P 500 must be at least 3% above its 200-day SMA to generate a buy signal and 3% below its 200-day SMA for a sell signal. This strategy turned bullish on January 31st and remains bullish. The 5-day SMA was 2.9% below the 200-day SMA on October 27th and did not trigger a sell signal. According to this measure, the S&amp;P 500 is still in a long-term uptrend. This simple filter seriously reduced the number of whipsaws because there were only 13 trades. The table below also shows a much improved performance. Compound Annual Return improved to 6% and the Maximum Drawdown dropped to 21.31%. The Win Rate more than tripled with an increase from 25% to 77%.The S&amp;P 500 is the most widely followed benchmark for US stocks and the 200-day SMA is the most popular long-term moving average. Perhaps the 200-day SMA works well for the S&amp;P 500 because some many traders, investors and institutions watch it. While it may be a self-fulfilling prophecy, it is important to know the status of the S&amp;P 500 because this is the single most important barometer for US stocks. In general, positive outcomes are more likely when the S&amp;P 500 is above its 200-day SMA and negative outcomes are more likely when the index is below its 200-day.Can we improve performance even more? How do the Nasdaq 100, S&amp;P MidCap 400 and Russell 2000 perform with long-term timing? This report continues for subscribers to TrendInvestorPro. Look for the update on Sunday.

"In the previous technical note, during our analysis of the patterns of the NIFTY's weekly chart, it was mentioned that the Index has achieved a full throwback. This occurs when the instrument gives up the breakout gains entirely and retests the original breakout point which acts as a strong support at least once. NIFTY ended up testing the 18850-18900 zone in the week before this one. The markets had a copy week, with it swinging both ways; it has made a strong attempt and has held the previous week's low of 18837 and formed a higher low. The Nifty traded in a 336-point range and has attempted to find a base for itself.In the end, the headline index closed with a net gain of 183.35 points (+0.96%) on a weekly basis.From a technical perspective, the markets have formed an Inside Bar on the charts, as NIFTY has formed a lower high and higher low. Having said this, what's more important is the fact that the NIFTY has defended the strong support zone of the and 18850-18900 levels; as of now, unless violated, this zone remains a very strong support zone for the NIFTY. The concerning factor is the volatility, as represented by INDIAVIX. Throughout the week, it stayed choppy, but, on a weekly note, it remained unchanged. The VIX closed at 10.88 with a change of just -0.21% on a weekly note. Any spikes here can once again leave the markets vulnerable to violent selloff; however, as of now, the zone of 18850-18900 remains crucial support to keep an eye on. So long as the NIFTY stays above this, it will continue staying in a broad trading range.Expect a buoyant start to the trade on Monday; the levels of 19400 and 19580 are likely to act as potential resistance points. The supports are likely to come in at 19000 and 18780 levels.The weekly RSI is 51.34; it remains neutral and does not show any divergence against the price. The weekly MACD is bearish and remains below its signal line.The pattern analysis shows a simple picture. NIFTY gave up all the gains that it had achieved following a breakout above 18850-18900 levels. Following a full throwback, as the index retested those levels and did so on expected lines, the said levels have acted as a strong support. Now, so long as NIFTY stays above this crucial support zone of 18850-18900, it will stay in a broad trading range. Any violation of this support zone will invite weakness. On the upside, the 20-week MA, which currently stands at 19482, can be viewed as immediate resistance for the markets.All in all, the coming week is likely to experience a positive start, and we may see the technical pullback getting extended. However, the same is likely to find resistance at 20-week MA. So long as NIFTY stays above the 18850-18900 zone, it will stay in a broad trading range. However, as the markets near the probable resistance levels, the low VIX is likely to cause trouble again, and this is something that one will need to watch. We are likely to see the markets staying extremely stock-specific; this is likely to prevent any one sector or group from dominating the performance space. While investors can continue to ride the technical rebound, it is equally important that profits are protected at higher levels. A cautiously positive approach is advised for the day.Sector Analysis for the Coming WeekIn our look at Relative Rotation Graphs®, we compared various sectors against CNX500 (NIFTY 500 Index), which represents over 95% of the free float market cap of all the stocks listed.Relative Rotation Graphs (RRG) indicate that the NIFTY Energy, IT, PSE, PSU Banks, and Infrastructure indices are inside the leading quadrant. The Realty index has also rolled inside the leading quadrant. These groups are collectively likely to outperform the broader markets.The NIFTY Mid-cap 100 index has rolled inside the weakening quadrant. The Pharma, Auto, and Metal indices are also inside the weakening quadrant.The NIFTY Financial Service, FMCG, and BankNifty indices are inside the lagging quadrant; however, they appear to be improving on their relative momentum against the broader markets.The NIFTY Services sector is inside the improving quadrant. Additionally, the Consumption index has also rolled inside the improving quadrant, indicating a potential beginning of its phase of relative outperformance.Important Note: RRG™ charts show the relative strength and momentum of a group of stocks. In the above Chart, they show relative performance against NIFTY500 Index (Broader Markets) and should not be used directly as buy or sell signals.  Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA Consulting Technical Analyst www.EquityResearch.asia | www.ChartWizard.ae",stockcharts,2023-11-07 10:01:35.688719
"""Are you bullish or bearish on the Nasdaq 100?""I often get asked this or a similar question for the S&amp;P 500, gold, bonds, individual stocks, Bitcoin, and pretty much anything else you can imagine that has a price. My follow-up question is always, ""Well, what's your timeframe?""It's tempting to analyze a chart, measure the trends, break down all sorts of technical indicators, and then boil it down to one single call: bullish or bearish. But mindful investors know that the market moves on multiple timeframes, with short-term ripples turning into medium-term waves, which are part of the long-term tides. Given this week's sudden rally, reversing last week's dismal deterioration, I thought it be helpful to focus in on the Nasdaq 100 and identify the trends on three different timeframes. I think you'll find that while the tactical timeframe ended this week in a bullish phase, the medium-term timeframe may provide better clues about what's next for stocks.Short-Term: Rally Mode but Testing ResistanceYou can't deny the strength of the uptrend this week, which provided a stark contrast to last week's dredging. Last week, we saw a clear distribution, as three of the five trading days ended near that day's low. This week, instead, most day's sessions closed near the top of the daily range.The last three months have developed a clear pattern of lower highs and lower lows on the chart. Notice how the current upswing appears very similar in price change and time duration to previous rallies in early October and late August? Now look down to the RSI, and you'll see that the RSI is right around 60, pretty much where the indicator topped out in those previous two countertrend upswings. So while this recent rally has been sudden, severe, and seductive, it actually tracks quite well with other bear market rallies we've experienced.Thus, while I'm drawn in by the intensity of this recent rally, I wouldn't be surprised to see at least a brief pullback from this clear resistance level.Medium-Term: Downtrend Still in PlaceWhen you take a step back to a two-year daily chart, you'll see how the downtrend channel fits into the overall trends of 2022-2023. On the medium-term time frame, I've considered this market as guilty until proven innocent. Once this consistent pattern of lower highs and lower lows appears, I think you have to assume that the downtrend will persist until proven otherwise.So what would we need to see to turn more bullish on the medium-term time frame? First, I'd watch for a breakout through the upper boundary of this trend channel. Friday's move higher made me think we might see a breakout before the weekend, but now I'd say this is the most important line to watch in the week to come. A breakout would suggest that new buyers are entering the market or at least that the pessimism that has pervaded this market into the fourth quarter is starting to dissipate.Another indication to watch for would be the RSI pushing above the key 60 level. Recent countertrend rallies saw the RSI top out around 60, so a price breakout accompanied by an RSI pushing above 60 could validate a more constructive medium-term thesis.Long-Term: Bullish Thesis Remains IntactWhy is the long-term picture still bullish in my opinion? Because the downtrend starting in July didn't break below the first Fibonacci support level around 338. Because the Nasdaq 100 remained above its 200-day moving average. Because when you zoom out to the weekly chart, the recent correction seems fairly minor by historical standards.The weekly QQQ chart illustrates how the real painful corrections start with a break below the 40-week moving average but then usually keep going. This is why so many investors track the 40-week or 200-day moving average because as long as the market remains above this key long-term barometer, any pullback is just not severe enough to break the larger trend.The weekly RSI is back above 50, and we are not too far below all-time highs for this leading growth index. So while the medium-term trend is still bearish by my read, the long-term charts show how we should still consider 2023 as part of a larger bull market structure.Which time frame is most important to you? What is your average investment horizon? However you would answer those questions, never forget the value of going one time frame larger and one time frame smaller. Only by considering the trends in other time frames can we better understand our main investing time frame.RR#6,DaveP.S.

"Yesterday, the SPX (SPY), OEX (OEF) and Dow Industrials (DIA) all saw new PMO Crossover BUY Signals. Today, they were joined by the remainder of the major indexes. The market is clicking; now we need to determine how long this rally will stick around.Seeing so many oversold PMO BUY Signals is especially bullish. They are all oversold signals as well. Our only caution would be that we did see similar signals early last month and they didn't produce a lengthy rally. The signals came in just in time for the decline.

The Silver Cross Index measure the percentage of stocks within the index holding a ""Silver Cross"" or 20-EMA above the 50-EMA. When the Silver Cross Index moves above its signal line (10-day EMA), it is called a Bullish Shift.

"Five up days in a row for the S&amp;P 500 ($SPX), Dow Jones Industrial Average ($INDU), and the Nasdaq Composite ($COMPQ)! That's a drastic change in investor sentiment from October.Following the end of a dismal month, the first week of November delivered the strongest weekly close seen this year. And it's not just mega-cap big tech names. All S&amp;P sectors, except Energy, ended in the green. For a Friday, that's an impressive showing. Does this mean investors can expect November to follow its expected seasonality pattern and ignite a rally to the end of the year?CHART 1: THE S&amp;P 500 INDEX, NASDAQ COMPOSITE, AND DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE CLOSED ABOVE THEIR 50-DAY MOVING AVERAGE. The strong finish was mostly due to the possibility that the Fed may be done hiking interest rates. Note the significant drop in the VIX.Chart source: StockChartsACP. For educational purposes.Weakening Labor Market and ManufacturingA lot of the investor optimism may be riding on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments on Wednesday after the decision to leave interest rates unchanged at 5.25–5.5%. Although Powell didn't say the Fed was done raising rates, investors assumed that there would probably be no more rate hikes given the results of the more recent economic data.The October jobs report came in weaker than expected, which helped ease some concerns. October's unemployment rate is 3.9%, indicating that the effects of interest rate hikes are beginning to show their impact. Manufacturing jobs are also slowing despite the recent strikes. Last month, 150,000 jobs were added, much lower than the 170,000 that was expected. ISM services for October came in at 51.8, less than the 53 estimate. So, a soft jobs report and a weakening manufacturing sector support the narrative that the Fed is done raising interest rates.Stocks, Bonds, and Everything In BetweenEquities continued to rise, Treasury yields fell, and the CBOE Volatility Index ($VIX) fell sharply to around 15. Earlier this week, the VIX was hovering around the 20 level, which was a concern. But that changed quickly. The picture the charts are revealing as this trading week comes to a close is one that illustrates how quickly investor sentiment can change. It's a classic scenario of herd mentality at work—investors rush to stocks for fear of missing out.At times like this, it's best to be calm, determine what might be happening under the hood, and enter your trades when the time is right.Market breadth indicators are a great way to understand the health of the different indexes. One breadth indicator to review is the bullish percent index (BPI). StockCharts publishes the bullish percent index for indexes, sectors, and industry groups. You could create a ChartList of the different BPIs and scroll through them to identify which indexes, sectors, or industry groups exhibit bullish sentiment. It can reveal some interesting scenarios that may be worth diving into. Focus on the Financial SectorFor example, the S&amp;P Financial Sector Bullish Percent Index just crossed above the 50 level, which should prompt you to check out the Financial sector. One way to do that is to bring up a chart of the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF). It has followed a path similar to the S&amp;P 500—five up days in a row. XLF has crossed above its 50- and 200-day SMAs and closed at the 100-day SMA.CHART 2: DAILY CHART OF XLF. The Financial sector is showing strength, which could be because of falling Treasury yields.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.Even regional banks are doing well. The daily chart of the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) below shows how this troubled subsector is beginning to show signs of life.CHART 3: DAILY CHART OF S&amp;P REGIONAL BANKING ETF (KRE). The ETF didn't close above its 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, but it's worth watching. Note the Financial Sector Bullish Percent Index in the bottom panel.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.Using Fibonacci retracement levels from the May low to the July high, the ETF has stalled at the Fib levels, for the most part, during its downward move from July to October. The ETF is now battling with its 38.2% Fib retracement level. A break above this level with follow-through would be a good time to accumulate some shares of KRE or its top holdings. The top 5 holdings are:Trust Financial Corporation (TFC) M&amp;T Bank Corp. (MTB)First Horizon National Corp. (FHN) Zion (ZION)Western Alliance Bancorp. (WAL)Looking through the daily charts of the five stocks listed above, the one that looks closer to starting its upward move is Western Alliance. Looking at its daily chart below, you can see that the stock has crossed above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA), its SCTR score is at around 97.5, and its relative strength index (RSI) is between 50 and 70, which indicates the stock has room to run.CHART 4: WESTERN ALLIANCE BANCORP CLOSED ABOVE 200-DAY SMA. With a SCTR score of 97.5 and an RSI of 62, this stock has room to rally.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.The fall in Treasury yields is good news for banks since it opens the door to servicing loans. The 30-year yield, which at one point was above 5%, has pulled back to its 50-day SMA, and the 10-year and 5-year yields traded below their 50-day SMA.The reversal in market sentiment happened quickly, and there's a chance it could be short-lived. Things can always go awry, and any piece of news that shifts investor thinking can quickly reverse the market. That's been the nature of the beast of late.In a recent episode of The Final Bar, our chief market strategist, David Keller, CMT, said it best; ""In a bullish phase, the market is innocent until proven guilty, and in a bearish phase, the market is guilty until proven innocent."" Given that equities are in a bearish phase, what do you need to see for the market to prove itself innocent?The broader indexes would have to overcome the trend of lower highs and lower lows. The S&amp;P 500 ($SPX) and Dow Jones Industrial Average are very close to their previous highs, and with the speed at which the indexes have moved higher in the last five days, the wait may be relatively short. Will the stock market prove its innocence? It's possible, but we'll have to wait till next week to find out.End-of-Week Wrap-UpUS equity indexes up; volatility down$SPX up 0.94% at 4358.34, $INDU up 0.66% at 34,061.32; $COMPQ up 1.38% at 13478.28$VIX down 4.73% at 14.92Best performing sector for the week: Real EstateWorst performing sector for the week: EnergyTop 5 Large Cap SCTR stocks: Vertiv Holdings, LLC (VRT); Palantir Technologies, Inc.

"Shopify (SHOP) share value jumped by over 20% Thursday morning after stunning analysts with a sharp earnings beat and rosy guidance. The stock reached the top of the StockCharts Technical Rank report in the Large Cap, Top Up category.CHART 1: SHOPIFY STOCK SAW THE LARGEST SCTR RISE ON NOVEMBER 3, 2023.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.Despite a 35% fall from its 2023 high of $71.43, its comeback suggests that the e-commerce industry is still kicking.Can SHOP sustain this upward momentum? Where might an effective entry point be, and what headwinds lie above the current price? Let's take a closer look, starting with the monthly chart.CHART 2. MONTHLY CHART OF SHOP. As the stock attempts to reverse, note how the dwindling volume coincides with a drying-up of selling activity. Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.Looking back on a monthly scale, you can see SHOP's plunge. The end of 2022 saw SHOP's bearish capitulation, leading to a rally and a near-term drop. While volume has receded significantly since the middle of 2022, so too did the selling pressure, as shown by the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF).On the weekly chart below, you can see that SHOP formed a Head-and-Shoulders Bottom pattern from the middle to the end of last year.CHART 3. WEEKLY CHART OF SHOP. The head-and-shoulders bottom pattern that formed toward the end of last year painted a bullish picture of SHOP's recovery.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.Many traders use the head-and-shoulders pattern daily to make tactical decisions. On a weekly scale, the pattern indicates longer-term trend shifts, often reflecting broader fundamental factors. And in this case, the indication is bullish.  Note that SHOP prices have been hovering resiliently over the neckline level of $45 since January 2023.CHART 4. DAILY CHART OF SHOP. Planning your trade around support and resistance is critical. Plus, be aware that breakaway gaps often don't get filled.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.SHOP's surge came in the form of a breakaway gap—in this case, a gap up from a near-term downtrend. Breakaway gaps have a low fill rate. And while this would tempt some traders to go long now, it helps to see the bigger context. The relative strength index (RSI) is rising, and though it's approaching the 70 level, it might also just reflect the magnitude of today's post-earnings jump.Eventually, SHOP may come across historical resistance levels at $67 and $71.50. Until then, there's strong support at $50.50 and, below that, $45.50.The Bottom LineIf you were bullish on SHOP leading up to Thursday's earnings, you might have entered a position immediately upon market open. Again, breakaway gaps don't often get filled, especially in the week of the gap, but there's never any guarantee.Keep your eye on Shopify stock as investors assess whether there's enough fundamental fuel to justify the technical break. Whether you're already long the stock or planning to enter a position soon, set an alert at support and/or resistance depending on your strategy. Disclaimer: This blog is for educational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice.

"The holiday season and discretionary spending can be synonymous, ringing in a boom in retail profits. And with Halloween in the rearview mirror, it's time to strategize a few killer plays in the retail arena.Perhaps it's no coincidence that, upon running a StockCharts Technical Rankings (SCTR) report using the US Industries menu, the Dow Jones US Broadline Retail Index ($DJUSRB) emerged among the top outperformers with an impressive score of 98.9 (see below). The holiday shopping season has started, so it's worth looking more closely at this industry. Retailers in this industry have diverse products and services that work across several sectors.CHART 1: US INDUSTRIES SCTR RANKING. $DJUSRB ranked second in the US Industries category.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.CHART 2: DAILY CHART OF $DJUSRB. The index is currently pulling back, but shows several support levels should the bounce fail to break above the most recent swing.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.The index bounced off the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level from the December 2022 low to the September 2023 high. It's outperforming the S&amp;P 500 index ($SPX) by over 6% and looks like it's on the verge of moving even higher.So, How Might Inflation Affect Holiday Spending?According to recent consumer spending reports, cash is flowing out of pockets and into the hands of retailers despite inflation and mounting household debt. ""Borrow and spend freely"" seems to be the main theme as we head toward the end of 2023.Still, you must consider the toll that inflation may eventually have on consumers' spending pockets, especially when it comes time to play Santa Claus. And that makes the Dow Jones US Broadline Retailers Index particularly sturdy this holiday season.In 2022, AMZN took the largest share of holiday shopping (around 41%). It's also a large component of the $DJUSRB. Looking at the daily chart of AMZN below, you can see that the stock is outperforming the S&amp;P 500 index ($SPX) by about 29%. It also has a strong SCTR score.CHART 3: DAILY CHART OF AMZN. The recent slide in AMZN's stock price suggests that buying momentum may be slowing.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.Though AMZN has pulled back, it appears to be clawing to challenge its September high. However, there's a deceleration in buying pressure, and you can view this more clearly if you look at the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) in the lower chart panel. AMZN bounced strongly off the 200-day SMA line and broke above its most recent swing high of 134.50. It will have to challenge its 2023 high of 145.85 if its uptrend is to remain valid.Let's look at some of the other US large retailers, starting with Walmart (WMT).CHART 4: DAILY CHART OF WMT. The stock price is about to challenge its all-time high, and the CMF shows that buying pressure is still strong.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.WMT, too, is outperforming the S&amp;P 500, and the buying pressure, as exhibited by the CMF, concurs with this reading in momentum. Though WMT's price appears to be pulling back, it has several levels of support, including its 100-day and 200-day SMAs before its 50% Fib retracement. If WMT breaks above 165.75, it will have reached record highs, and right now, it looks poised to break above that level.Like WMT, Costco (COST) benefits from a diverse suite of private-label products and economies of scale, allowing it to control costs better and maximize profits.CHART 5: DAILY CHART OF COST. Investors seem indecisive about accumulating CSCO stock.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.Technically, COST is experiencing higher levels of volatility as it approaches its all-time high above 600. It also outperformed the S&amp;P 500, though its relative performance exhibits slight indecision. Its CMF reading is positive, but shows divergence over the last month (see the flat blue line on the CMF and compare it to Costco's rising trajectory, leading to its pullback and the following fluctuations).Although COST appears to have bounced off its 100-day SMA, if it falls further, it has plenty of technical support between 510 and 530, where the 38.2% and 50% Fib retracements are clustered along with the 200-day SMA.The stock price for Target (TGT) presents a different scenario. Amid a high-interest rate environment, mounting theft, and, particularly, a strong consumer backlash against certain products, TGT shows the most epic falling knife scenario (see chart below) among the largest retail giants. Still, it's an arguably solid company with a diverse portfolio of cost-competitive offerings. CHART 6: DAILY CHART OF TGT. Ouch! However, the selling pressure looks like it's drying up. If it breaks out to the upside, its reversal faces many headwinds.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.It's difficult to predict if the stock price has bottomed, but certain levels can help you gauge its advance and momentum once it begins to show signs of recovery. And the holiday season may provide the catalyst for TGT's upside reversal.TGT is caught within tight consolidation between roughly 106 and 113.50 after a 42% plunge from its 2023 high of 177.50. Its SCTR score of 13 and -38% underperformance against the S&amp;P 500 underscore the severity of TGT's drop. Any early signs of a recovery would begin with a close above resistance at 113.50. The CMF indicator paints a slightly optimistic picture of this likely upside break as selling pressure recedes, and buying activity sends the indicator above the zero line for the first time in four months. But even if TGT bulls attempt to rally the stock, it has multiple resistance levels. Drawing a Fibonacci retracement from its 2023 peak to its lowest point, you can expect resistance between 132.50 (38.2%) and 140 (50%), a range in which the 200-day SMA will likely be met. Also, 125 and 137.50, the bottom and top of a previous rectangle formation, will likely provide additional resistance, adding to TGT's technical headwinds (not to mention the consumer-driven headwinds that played a significant part in its near-term demise). Actionable LevelsAMZN, WMT, and COST are all prone to pullbacks, while TGT awaits signs of a potential reversal. Each stock presents different technical scenarios, momentum profiles, and potential support levels. Where you choose to buy (if you're bullish) depends on your level of aggressiveness and means of (bullish) confirmation. Fibonacci and SMA levels (as well as swing points) also present different stop-loss scenarios that can be trailed should you find yourself on the right side of the market.The Bottom LineAs we enter the holiday season, retail stocks will likely take center stage. The Dow Jones US Broadline Retail Index ($DJUSRB) shines with a robust SCTR score. Its biggest component, Amazon (AMZN) faces challenges. Other large retailers show different scenarios—Walmart's gaining ground, Costco is wavering, and Target is eyeing a comeback. Add these four retail stocks to your StockCharts ChartLists and set alerts at the possible support and resistance levels shown in the above charts.

"The equity markets consolidated throughout the week. While staying in a narrow range and trading sideways for almost all days of the week, the Indices stayed devoid of any directional trend. Following strong weekly gains of over 1.58% in the week before this one, the NIFTY chose to remain in a defined range; the trading range got narrower and the Nifty oscillated in the 204.65 points range while defending the most immediate support of the 20-week MA. The benchmark index closed with net weekly gains of just 62.90 points (+0.32%).Although some intraday spikes of volatility were observed, IndiaVIX declined by 4.21% to 11.33 on a weekly basis. While no major technical event/development took place over the past five sessions, the point of focus remains the 20-week MA which is acting as the most immediate short-term support for the Nifty. This 20-week MA is placed at 19570; so long as the Index can keep its head above this point on a closing basis, it will continue to consolidate. However, any violation of this WMA on a closing basis will invite incremental weakness for the markets. This makes the 19500-19570 the most immediate and important support zone for the Nifty.We have a long weekend this time with Monday, 27th November being a trading holiday on account of Guru Nanak Jayanti. The coming week also has a monthly derivatives expiry lined up as well. Tuesday will see the Markets starting by adjusting themselves to the global trade setup. The levels of 19900 and 20030 are likely to act as potential resistance levels. The supports are expected to come in at 19610 and 19480 levels.The weekly RSI is 59.94; it continues to stay neutral while not showing any divergence against the price. The weekly MACD stays bearish and remains below its signal line. No major formations on the candles were seen.The pattern analysis of Nifty on the weekly charts shows that the Index continues to inch higher while staying inside a rising channel. Having said this, in the previous week, the index has formed a similar top and higher bottom on the charts. This makes the level of 19875 one of the pattern resistance levels. Overall, the zone of 19850-19900 remains an important resistance zone; unless this zone is taken out, the Nifty is likely to stay in a defined range and consolidate. The most immediate support on a closing basis is at 20-week MA which is presently placed at 19570.69.All in all, over the coming truncated week, the markets may continue to stay in a broadly defined range while staying devoid of any major directional bias. A sustainable trend will emerge only after the Nifty takes out the 18900 levels comprehensively or violates 19500-19550 on a closing basis. Unless either of these levels is taken out on the upside or violated on the downside, we will continue seeing Nifty in a trading range. It would be prudent to protect profits at higher levels while investing in stocks that are relatively stronger or have improving relative strength. A selective approach is advised over the coming week.Sector Analysis for the coming weekIn our look at Relative Rotation Graphs®, we compared various sectors against CNX500 (NIFTY 500 Index), which represents over 95% of the free float market cap of all the stocks listed.Relative Rotation Graphs (RRG) do not show any major change in the sectoral setup as compared to the previous week. The Nifty Energy, Commodities, Realty, PSE, PSUBank, and Infrastructure indices are inside the leading quadrant. These pockets are expected to continue to outperform the broader NIFTY 500 Index relatively.The NIFTY IT Index has rolled inside the weakening quadrant of the RRG. Besides this, the Auto, Media, Midcap 100, Pharma, and Metal indices are also inside the weakening quadrant. However, Auto and Pharma indices continue to show improvement in their relative momentum.NiftyBank is the only index inside the lagging quadrant. However, that is also showing signs of improvement in its relative momentum against the broader markets.Nifty Services sector, Financial Services, FMCG, and Consumption Indices are inside the improving quadrant. The FMCG and the Consumption space look better placed to improve its relative performance against the broader markets.Important Note: RRG™ charts show the relative strength and momentum of a group of stocks. In the above Chart, they show relative performance against NIFTY500 Index (Broader Markets) and should not be used directly as buy or sell signals.  Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA Consulting Technical Analyst www.EquityResearch.asia | www.ChartWizard.ae",stockcharts,2023-11-27 17:19:08.004903
"We can use sentiment indicators for a lot of purposes.  I routinely follow the 5-day SMA of the equity only put call ratio ($CPCE) to help spot short- to intermediate-term bottoms.  It's not quite so effective at calling market tops, but it does work in that regard many times as well.  When I go out on a limb to call major market bottoms, my CPCE work is usually one piece of my analysis in putting together that jigsaw puzzle.  I also have studied the Volatility Index ($VIX) a great deal.  The VIX is the annualized ""implied volatility"" of the S&amp;P 500 that helps investors estimate how much the S&amp;P 500 will fluctuate over the next 30 days.  The calculation is based on near-term S&amp;P 500 options traded on the CBOE.  If market makers are expecting high volatility ahead (normally during market downturns), premiums on these options will be higher and more costly for traders.  When market makers are expecting low volatility ahead (normally during bullish market periods), premiums on these options will be lower and less costly.  When we see big stock market declines, option premiums skyrocket and the VIX accelerates higher.  Historically, the stock market doesn't perform well with the VIX above 20, which is why I watch that level so closely.Let me illustrate how the S&amp;P 500 has performed when the VIX is at various levels:This chart goes back to 2013, when the S&amp;P 500 cleared its double top from 2000 and 2007, effectively ending the secular bear market from 2000 through 2013.  It's a chart of the VIX, but I've broken it down by value.  The red-shaded area highlights S&amp;P 500 annualized returns when the VIX closes above 20.  The yellow-shaded area highlights S&amp;P 500 performance when the VIX is in the 17-20 range.  The light-green shaded area highlights performance when the VIX closes in the 13-17 range and the dark-green shaded are highlights performance when the VIX closes below 13.  You can see that the lower the VIX goes, the better the S&amp;P 500 performs.  This performance chart also suggests that we be extremely careful whenever the VIX is above 20.  I'd argue it makes sense to be in cash to eliminate stock market risk at that point - or at least take steps to reduce risk.One thing we can conclude from looking at the above chart.  The VIX closed on Friday at 12.46, falling into that dark-green shaded area.  Typically good things happen when the VIX is this low.  I know there are plenty of people that believe a market crash is right around the corner.  Sorry, but the VIX in the 12s indicates that we shouldn't be considering that AT ALL right now.I'll give you a couple more stats from the research I did.  First, you need to know that during the current secular bull market advance, there have been 2677 trading days and the S&amp;P 500 has closed higher 54.2% of those days.  I've broken down the chance of the S&amp;P 500 closing higher when the VIX is in each of those shaded areas on the chart.  Check this out:% of days S&amp;P 500 closes higher when VIX closes above 20:  44.81%% of days S&amp;P 500 closes higher when VIX closes between 17-20:  51.04%% of days S&amp;P 500 closes higher when VIX closes between 13-17:  55.34%% of days S&amp;P 500 closes higher when VIX closes under 13:  66.28%The lower the VIX goes, the more bullish the stock market gets.

"The percentage of stocks in long-term uptrends rebounded sharply in November and returned to the highs from late August and early September. This rebound is impressive, but the absolute levels are still not that inspiring. We need to see participation breakouts and higher participation levels to get the broad bull market back. The chart below shows the percentage of stocks above the 200-day SMA for the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq 100, S&amp;P MidCap 400 and S&amp;P SmallCap 600. This breadth indicator tells us how many stocks are in long-term uptrends, and long-term downtrends. In general, these indicators need to exceed 60% to show enough participation to signal a broad bull market. First, note I am concerned because these indicators broke their spring-summer lows with deep declines into late October (green shading). The percentage of large-caps ($SPX), mid-caps ($MID) and small-caps ($SML) above their 200-day SMAs dipped to the 25% area. A plunge this deep shows a serious increase in downside participation. The indicators rebounded sharply with the November advance, but those based on the broad stock indexes have yet to exceed 60% and are at their moment of truth. Note that the percentage of Nasdaq 100 stocks above the 200-day SMA is at 71% and the strongest of the four, by far. The red shading marks the highs from late August and September. While I am impressed with the November surge, I would like to see the percentage of stocks above the 200-day SMA expand above these levels (and above 60%). We can then starting talking about a broad bull market. TrendInvestorPro uses the percentage of stocks above the 200-day SMA in its Composite Breadth Model, which remains bearish. Even though the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq 100 and some large-caps are performing well, long-term breadth is lagging and large pockets of weakness remain.Recent Reports at TrendInvestorPro The Essential Breadth Indicator ChartList (with report and video)Building a Strategy around the Zweig Breadth ThrustMomentum Rotation Strategy for NDX and SPX StocksMean-Reversion Strategy for Russell 1000 StocksSpecial Action for StockCharts Extra and Pro MembersGet the edge with inside information, information inside the indexes and sectors, that is.

"In this week's edition of Moxie Indicator Minutes, TG notes that the markets are deciding to hang on tight to their upper levels over the holiday week. He thinks we still need a pullback, but perhaps it will be more of a flag. Either way, initiating long trades right here and now is not ideal, so he argues that it's time be patient, waiting for dips to show up and provide buying opportunities.This video was originally broadcast on November 24, 2023.

"The Dow Jones Industrial Index ($INDU) is reaching overhead resistance between 35.5k and 35.7k, which means that upside potential is now limited. Even if the market manages to break that area, the next resistance level is already around just 37k.However, the relative rotation graph featuring the rotation for all 30 members of the DJ Industrials Index is showing some potentially very interesting pair trade setups.DJ IndustrialsOn the weekly chart above, that overhead resistance area is clearly visible. The previous highs, which define the resistance zone, date back to late 2021 and early 2022, almost two years ago. This makes it a very important resistance zone.An upward break of that resistance will obviously be a very bullish signal. But the recent rally, coming out of the late October low, has been very steep, and it would not be strange to see some form of consolidation against the aforementioned resistance zone.With overhead resistance nearby, the near-term risk is now to the downside. Looking at the chart, a setback after a peak against resistance could take the Dow as low as 32.3k. This would still keep $INDU within the boundaries of this year's trading range.Opposite Tails on Weekly RRGThe weekly relative rotation graph above shows the rotations for all thirty stocks inside the Dow Jones Industrial Index. With the benchmark index still inside a trading range, some of the opposite rotations that are visible on the graph suggest that a few interesting pair trading opportunities are present.In order to clean up the RRG and put emphasis on the more interesting rotations, I have taken out the tails with less favorable characteristics.In order to see if I could get confirmation, I have run the same RRG on the daily time frame.Given the current rotational patterns, many different pair trading opportunities can be found. I encourage you to do your own research and find out whether you have a particularly strong view of specific stocks or combinations of stocks, positive or negative. Here, I will pick two examples of potential pair trades from the RRGs above and look at the individual charts.NKE vs. CATOn the weekly RRG, Nike and Caterpillar's tails are rotating in opposite directions. NKE is inside the improving quadrant and rapidly heading toward leading. CAT is inside the weakening quadrant and rapidly heading toward lagging. Both tails are at the extremes of the RRG and far away from the benchmark. This indicates a big potential for alpha.NKENKE is nearing resistance between 110 and 115, suggesting that there is limited upside potential left, unless NKE can clear this barrier in the coming weeks. However, as we are looking for pair trades, we need to focus more on the relative strength conditions. And these are clearly picking up for NKE.The JdK RS-Momentum line is already well above 100 and is dragging the JdK RS-Ratio line higher. When both RRG-lines are moving up at the same time, this causes an RRG heading between 0-90 degrees, which we know is an indication of strength.CATOn the price chart, CAT has just bounced off its rising support line. The relative performance, however, is not looking that good. The JDK RS-momentum line already dropped below 100 a few weeks ago and is now rapidly dragging the RS-Ratio line lower. This rapid decline in relative strength suggests a further underperformance for CAT in the next few weeks.Off-setting the relative strength of NKE against the relative weakness of CAT makes for a potentially interesting pair-trading opportunity.MSFT vs. MRKThe weekly RRG details for Microsoft and Merck show opposite rotational patterns. MSFT has just completed a rotation from leading through weakening and is now back into leading, making it one of the strongest stocks, if not the strongest, in this universe. The opposite goes for MRK, which rotated from lagging into improving and is now crossing back into the lagging quadrant.We know that rotations that complete on one side of the graph indicate a new up- or down-leg in an already established up or downtrend.MSFTThe recent break to new all-time highs is holding up well. It has also caused the raw RS-line to push to new highs where it is also holding. This is a strong combination of facts.After a brief dip below 100, the JdK RS-Momentum line has now crossed back above that level again, dragging the RS-ratio out of its low just above 100. This causes the tail on the RRG to push back into the leading quadrant at a strong RRG-heading.The combination of strong relative strength and a break to new highs on the price chart makes Microsoft the best chart in this universe for the time being.MRKMRK reached its all-time high in May of this year, but has been in a steady downtrend since then. The price of Merck reached support just above 100 a few weeks ago and is still hovering slightly above that area at the moment. A break lower will very likely accelerate the decline, very likely, toward the next level of support, between 92.50 and 95.The raw RS line is breaking an important horizontal support level, completing a toppish formation. The RRG lines already picked up on the new downtrend in July. The recent hiccup of the RS-Momentum line above 100 is the result of the sideways consolidation of relative strength above support.With raw RS breaking support and the RS momentum line dropping below 100, both RRG-Lines are now once again moving lower while below 100. This is causing the tail on the RRG to move deeper into the lagging quadrant while traveling at a negative heading.Both tails completing a rotation at the same side of the RRG suggests a continuation of the ongoing outperformance of MSFT over MRK.Enjoy your Thanksgiving weekend, but #StayAlert, --Julius",stockcharts,2023-11-27 17:19:08.010571
"I know we're in the midst of a powerful rally that began EXACTLY when seasonality suggested it would - at the close on October 27th.  I discussed the very bearish seasonality leading up to that October 27th close in my article, ""Odds Favor Further Selling This Week (Maybe a LOT of it)"".  Check it out if you haven't already.  At the end of this article, I pointed out that bullish historical tendencies would soon overpower the bears and we've seen history repeat itself once again as the bulls have dominated the bears during the latter part of October and throughout November.Technical Price ActionBefore I provide more bullish historical tendencies ahead, let's look at the S&amp;P 500 over multiple time frames:S&amp;P 500 - 1 Year Daily:Pretty simple.  We had a correction.  The downtrend was broken.  We're now trending higher with approaching price resistance near 4600.  To the downside, a gap support zone resides from 4411-4559 and the rising 20-day EMA is conveniently located in the middle of it at 4437.S&amp;P 500 - 5 Years Weekly:Sure looks like a bullish inverse head &amp; shoulders continuation pattern to me.  The pattern is almost perfectly symmetrical and it follows a very clear uptrend.  The beauty here is that the pattern measurement is from the 4600 neckline down to the inverse head just below 3500.  That's 1100 points.  A breakout above 4600 would measure up 1100 points to 5700.  Good luck bears!  During uptrends, the RSI tends to hold the 40-50 range.  Note the October low was squarely on 40.  Now the RSI is back above 60.  This is how the RSI unfolds during bull market advances.  I also love the PPO reset at the zero line.  We're now moving straight up off of that test, and that's indicative of accelerating bullish momentum.  S&amp;P 500 - 40 Years Monthly:Do you see anything other than an uptrend?  The red-shaded areas highlight what we typically see during secular (long-term) bear markets.  From 2000 to 2013, we saw ZERO meaningful breakouts.  It wasn't until April 10th, 2013 that the secular bull market began, making a definitive breakout above the 1550-1575 area.  Since then, we've seen cyclical bear markets and corrections, but nothing more.  Yet permabears try to call every downturn the beginning of the next collapse.  And they're always wrong.  We'll have scary times again, but it ain't now - at least not in my opinion.  The 2030s could be a much different story, but I see the current trend higher continuing for a number of years.  Note that our monthly PPO typically remains above zero and our monthly RSI remains above 40 throughout secular bull markets.  Selling doesn't last long enough to take these indicators below the required zero and 40 levels, respectively.  But we have to deal with the ""sky is falling!"" media and permabears throughout.  If you need a ""default"", default as a bull.  You'll be right much more often.Historical TendenciesWe remain in the strongest and most bullish time of the calendar year, which I define as October 27th close through January 18th close.  That's based on my 73 years of research on the S&amp;P 500, dating back to 1950.  We still have some not-so-bullish periods during November, December, and January, but the overwhelming bias is to the upside.  For instance, the November 21st through December 6th period yields an annualized return of +32.97% over the past 7 decades, nearly quadrupling the average annual S&amp;P 500 return of +9.00%.  Don't misunderstand me.  This doesn't guarantee us higher prices for the next couple weeks.  Instead, it's simply providing us a seasonal tendency for stock prices to move higher.  I use seasonality as a secondary indicator, much like PPO and RSI.  The primary indicator is always price action.I'm still offering my FREE PDF, ""Bowley Trend Part 1:  Long-Term Trends Since 1950"".  I use it to help guide me in my trading.  You probably don't realize it, but there's an 11-day period of EVERY calendar month (THE SAME DAYS EVERY SINGLE MONTH), or roughly 33% of all calendar days, that has provided more than 80% of the S&amp;P 500 gains since 1950.  As a stock trader, and especially if you trade options, you MUST know these days to get a leg up on everyone else.

"In the 1995 film, Home for the Holidays, family reunions are explored using both drama and comedy. The film illustrates how we outsiders looking in never really know the love and the madness that goes on inside any one family's home during Thanksgiving.Happily, our Economic Modern Family tends to be transparent.Beginning with our patriarch and matriarch, we see 2 different phases, similarities in leadership and divergent momentum. The Russell 2000 (IWM) is in a recovery or recuperation phase, trailing behind the SPY. Its momentum matches the price movement; both momo and price are struggling to clear key resistance. Furthermore, Granddad remains under the July 6-month calendar range low, certainly not a bullish sign. Gramps' holiday leans more to underscoring the market madness we see in NASDAQ.Granny Retail (XRT), has fared better since October 2023. Granny is in an accumulation phase, slightly outperforming the SPY, her momentum gaining traction. Granny is well beneath the July 6-month calendar range high, but has managed to clear back above the July 6-month calendar range low.The consumers' holiday mindset is one of cautious optimism.In Home for the Holidays, it is up to the mom and dad to hold the family together. Hence, if we look to Granddad and Grandma to hold our economic modern family together, we must also examine the impact, or lack thereof, that relationship has on some of the other key family members or their grandkids.Conveniently, Tommy in the film is a good representative for our Transportation (IYT) brother. Side note: the dad in the film is a retired airport maintenance man.Tommy is complicated. His cracked sense of humor disguises a softer heart. IYT, our ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" (speaking of movies), is also complicated. Through strikes, inflation, higher rates, and economic slowdowns, IYT is looking for love.In an accumulation phase, IYT has a way better performance relative to the SPY. Yet IYT remains in a downtrend, under the July 6-month calendar range low. Momentum is in a bearish divergence to price, as it has yet to clear its 200-DMA while price has. Is IYT more inclined to lead or follow from here? That is a big question and one that we should watch for the answer to so we can assess if this rally is sustainable.Sister Semiconductors SMH can be compared to the Holly Hunter character in Home for the Holidays. In the film, Holly Hunter supplies the point of view, and, like SMH, she tells us that the mania we see is not anything new. SMH is rallying beyond the rest of her Family, clearly NOT for the first time. The question is, can SMH continue holding up, given her grandparents and sibs remain mixed up?SMH is in a bullish phase. It is trading in an uptrend above its July 6-month calendar range high. SMH is outperforming SPY, but momentum shows us a bearish divergence.On Real Motion, the phase is recuperation, as opposed to bullish in price. Furthermore, the red dots which exhibit momentum, are below the 200-DMA and having a sell side mean reversion.If you put these four charts all together, we get a reunion that is filled with the makings of a family breakdown. While Granny XRT and Sister Semiconductors SMH give us investors reasons to feel good about gorging ourselves, the rest of the Family (IWM &amp; IYT) remind us not to eat what we cannot digest.This is for educational purposes only.

"Stocks are having a good November, which aligns with typical stock market behavior. According to the Stock Trader's Almanac 2023, both the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and the Friday after have a good track record. So, even though the stock market wraps up at 1 PM on Friday, it may be worth checking your portfolio value. Trading may be thin, since most traders would have taken the day off.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($INDU), S&amp;P 500 ($SPX), and Nasdaq Composite ($COMPQ) all closed higher. All three of the indexes are trading close to their all-time highs.  Even small- and mid-cap stocks are showing signs of strength. The S&amp;P 600 Small-Cap Index ($SML) and the S&amp;P 400 Mid-Cap Index ($MID) are trading above their yearly lows, but they have much catching up to do before hitting their all-time highs. All S&amp;P sectors except Energy were in the green after Wednesday's close. There was supposed to be an OPEC meeting today to discuss oil production cuts, but it didn't happen.Overall Market BreadthOn the equities front, it's encouraging to see market breadth strengthening (see chart below). The NYSE Common Stock Only Advance-Decline line is trending higher, the percentage of stocks trading above their 200-day moving average is at 56.4%, and the S&amp;P 500 Bullish Percent Index at 62.4, above the 50% threshold level. Overall, the S&amp;P 500 and other broader indexes are bullish.CHART 1: S&amp;P 500 MARKET BREADTH STRENGTHENS. As the S&amp;P 500 approaches its all-time high, it's encouraging to see market breadth widening. Advancers are greater than decliners, the percentage of S&amp;P 500 stocks trading above their 200-day moving average is rising, and the S&amp;P 500 Bullish Percent Index also indicates that investors are bullish.Chart source: StockChart.com. For educational purposes.Economic data has been mixed. Jobless claims didn't show much weakness and durable goods missed the downside. Earlier in the week, the Fed minutes indicated that the ""monetary policy will remain restrictive"" narrative is still in play. There was no hint of cutting rates in the near future.The economic news didn't impact the stock market too much. The November rally is still going strong, with the Nasdaq rallying almost 11%, the Dow up 6.6%, and the S&amp;P 500 up 8.45%.The Bond MarketThe 10-year US Treasury Yield Index ($TNX) fell to its 100-day simple moving average (SMA), which is acting as a support level. The yield bounced off the SMA and closed at 4.42% (see chart below). Lower yields tend to be good for stocks.CHART 2: 10-YEAR US TREASURY YIELD INDEX.  The 100-day simple moving average could be a support level to watch.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.Treasury yields move inversely to bond prices, so it's not surprising to see that the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) has been moving higher. If you've pulled out all your fixed-income investments, now may be time to start thinking about getting back in. But there's no need to rush, since TLT is still a long way for TLT to reach its yearly highs of around $106.Investor ComplacencyOverall, investor uncertainty has eased considerably since October. The CBOE Volatility Index ($VIX) is very close to its 52-week low, and the MOVE Index, a measure of volatility in the bond market, is also trending lower (see chart below). The VIX closed at 12.85.CHART 3: STOCK AND BOND VOLATILITY. The VIX (red line) and MOVE (blue line) are moving in the same direction, indicating that stock and bond investors are complacent.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.Investor complacency could make investors more optimistic and be inclined to take advantage of Black Friday deals.Black Friday shopping has already started, and retail stocks are showing mixed results. Shares of Amazon (AMZN) are trading close to its 52-week high. It's a similar scenario with Gap, Inc. (GPS) and Ross Stores (ROST). Target (TGT) saw its share price gap up on its recent earnings report. Things weren't the same for Walmart (WMT), with the stock price falling after its recent earnings report. WMT's earnings were strong, but the recent slowdown in consumer spending didn't sit well with investors. But that doesn't mean you should sell the stock. If you look at a weekly chart of WMT, the uptrend in the stock price is still intact.In Other NewsEarnings season may be coming to a close, but NVIDIA was the big one this week, closing lower today in spite of crushing Q3 earnings. Possible restrictions in China's chip exports may have had something to do with the selloff, although some profit-taking ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday shouldn't be alarming. NVDA is still a healthy company with a strong SCTR score and healthy relative strength with respect to the S&amp;P 500.A Thanksgiving HopeEven though the stock market's November rally is going strong ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, there's still a lot of turmoil in this world. Let's hope for steps toward peaceful resolutions.Disclaimer: This blog is for educational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice.

"SPX Monitoring Purposes: Long SPX 10/27/23 at 4117.37.
Gain since 12/20/22: Over 26%.
Monitoring Purposes GOLD:  Long GDX on 10/9/20 at 40.78.  Above is the monthly SPX chart. The pattern that appears to be forming is a head-and-shoulders bottom and the right shoulder is forming now. The neckline lies near the 4600 range and would need a ""Sign of Strength"" through that level to confirm this pattern. The bottom window is the monthly SPX/VIX ratio, which has made a higher high, while the SPX so far has made a lower high. The SPX/VIX ratio leads the SPX, suggesting that, at some point, the SPX will break to a higher high. We are long SPX 10/27/23 at 4117.37.We updated this chart from yesterday. The bottom window is the SPY, and next higher window is the TLT/VVIX ratio. It is common near short-term highs for the SPY to make higher highs and the TLT/VVIX ratio to make lower highs (noted in shaded pink). What we are seeing now is that the SPY is continuing to make higher highs and the TLT/VVIX ratio is also making higher highs, suggesting the current rally may continue (noted in shaded light blue). The SPY was up 5 days in a row going into Monday; going up 5 days in a row foretells the market will be higher within five days 83% of the time.Last Thursday's report said, ""above is the Bullish percent index for the Gold Miners index. The bullish percent index measures the percent on stocks that are on point and figure buy signals. For a valid bullish signal, the Bullish Percent index would need to rise. Since the beginning of October, the bullish percent index has been rising from 10% to the current reading of 25%, which in turn shows this market is getting stronger as more stocks trigger buy signals.

"Gap Inc.'s (GPS) blowout earnings report last week not only signaled the end of its summer slumber, but catapulted its share price to two-year highs. Last Friday, its shares jumped more than 30%, opening the day with a massive runaway gap.For a company whose sales have been declining for years, its reported earnings per share of $0.59 blew the doors off analysts' expectations of a mere $0.19 per share.But does this signal a comeback or a blip for Gap's stock price? Can the stock sustain this momentum and possibly move higher? And if it does continue its trend higher, how high can it go before running into major technical headwinds?First, let's look at what happened last week (and the price action leading up to it).CHART 1: DAILY CHART OF GAP STOCK PRICE. After hitting a low in May, Gap's stock price started showing signs of life, but that post-earnings runaway gap was something else.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.Gap's runaway gap is quite pronounced, as it leapt above its 52-week high. However, both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and volume are indicating that Gap's momentum is waning, and rapidly so.The RSI is giving us a reading over 84—placing Gap's stock price well within overbought territory. And volume since Friday has pulled back significantly, indicating that the buying activity that gave price its upward momentum is quickly drying up. Both indicate the likelihood of a pullback. And if price does decline, we can expect support at the 20-day simple moving average line, which currently coincides with the top price range prior to the post-earning runaway gap.Scanning for Stocks Gaining VolumeFrom Your Dashboard or Charts &amp; Tools tab, scroll to the Sample Scan Library and run the Strong Volume Gainers scan. The scan will filter out all the stocks and ETFs that meet the scan criteria.But there's another caveat to consider: According to (technical analyst) Thomas Bulkowski's studies, runaway gaps toward the upside tend to close (or get filled) only 8% of the time within a one-week period. In other words, stocks that experience runaway gaps to the upside have a tendency to keep running.And if it does, at what level (or range) might Gap's stock price hit a ceiling? A weekly chart can tell us.CHART 2: WEEKLY CHART OF GPS. Over a five-year period, the stock hasn't demonstrated any significant long-term trends.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.The price level of $23 marks the beginning of a range (extending up to $25) that will likely serve as major resistance to Gap's upward trajectory, should it manage to go that high. It served as resistance in November 2019 and repelled repeated attempts to close above it in November 2020, and twice again in September and November of 2021. So this is a price level to watch, especially if you happen to be long the stock.The Bottom LineGap's near-term outlook is mixed-to-negative, with the company expecting Q4 sales to fall year-over-year. But lower commodity costs and the company's cost-cutting strategies may be enough to see its profits rise over the coming quarters. From the above charts, you can see the lower and upper limits, where prices are likely to bounce either way.Disclaimer: This blog is for educational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice.

"On this episode of StockCharts TV's Sector Spotlight, I dive deep into rotations for asset classes and sectors. Bitcoin, as a proxy for crypto currencies as an asset class, is shooting off into the leading quadrant, while commodities are losing strength and stocks are back in the lead. In sectors, we see a move away from defensives, while Technology has jumped to new all-time highs. The Consumer Discretionary sector is currently putting some pressure on the market from a relative perspective, and therefore seems to be holding the key for a broader participation and stronger S&amp;P 500.This video was originally broadcast on November 20, 2023.

"Palantir Technologies (PLTR) was a ""talked-about"" stock shortly after its initial public offering (IPO) in September 2020. The stock reached a high of $45 in January 2021 and headed lower, trading sideways until about November 2021. From there, the stock price kept falling.CHART 1: WEEKLY CHART OF PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES (PLTR). The stock has been trending lower after reaching an all-time high of $45. Will the stock reach $45 again or stall?Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.The stock reached a low in December 2022. It has started showing signs of life, although it has been an up and down journey. The stock is now hitting new 52-week highs.CHART 2: DAILY CHART OF PLTR. The stock is trending higher, trading above its 21-day exponential moving average (EMA). PLTR also has a very high StockCharts Technical Rank (SCTR) score, and the percentage price oscillator is in positive territory. The stock has momentum that's pushing the stock higher. How much higher will it go?Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.The above chart shows the following points worth noting:StockCharts Technical Rank (SCTR) score has been consistently above 90 since May 2023.PLTR stock has been trading above its 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) since the price gapped up on November 2, 2023.The percentage price oscillator (PPO) is in positive territory, indicating bullish momentum.How To Scan for Stocks Hitting 52-Week HighsYou can scan for stocks hitting new 52-week highs using the New 52-Week Highs scan from the StockCharts Sample Scan Library. From Your Dashboard or Charts &amp; Tools tab, scroll to the Sample Scan Library and run the New 52-Week Highs scan. The scan will filter out all the stocks and ETFs that meet the scan criteria.How high can the stock go? Theoretically, it could reach its all-time high of $45, but it may not necessarily be smooth sailing. Looking at the weekly chart, PLTR could hit resistance around the $26–$29 level. If the stock price is able to break above this level, the next resistance could be anywhere from $37–$45.Why is scanning for stocks that are hitting new 52-week highs important? It goes back to the strategy of legendary stock trader Jesse Livermore. One of Livermore's criteria was to identify stocks that are breaking out on a new high. It meant the stock had overcome a resistance level and was likely to move higher. But the stock needs momentum. Without it, the stock price could fall back to its 21-day EMA.The bottom line: It's worth running the New 52-Week Highs scan on a regular basis and going through the charts of the stocks and ETFs that meet the criteria. Look for the momentum by looking at an indicator like the PPO and watching trading volume. Volume needs to be strong to push the price higher.Disclaimer: This blog is for educational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice.

All of our major indices gained ground, but the IWM nearly tripled the NASDAQ 100 and simply acted much more bullishly after the tame October CPI report was released on Tuesday morning before the opening bell.  That triggered a tsunami of buying on Tuesday.  After a brief pullback, the small cap bulls were back out on Friday.  I would treat the IWM as an uptrending ETF - until proven otherwise.  Check out the chart, with two key support levels identified:There's still much work to do, but the IWM is at least beginning to show significant improvement, especially on the absolute price chart.  The huge gap up on Tuesday now provides us excellent gap support at 174.23 and the rising 20-day EMA is currently at 172.17.  Those are the two support levels to watch closely.SectorsTwo sectors that had really struggled in 2023 due to higher interest rates were real estate (XLRE) and utilities (XLU).  It made sense for these two to perform well when investors poured into bonds last week, sending the 10-year treasury yield ($TNX) plummeting.  Consumer discretionary (XLY) had an excellent week as well.  You'll see below that 4 of the top 6 industry groups last week were in the consumer discretionary sector.I generally define a daily uptrend as ""price above the 20-day EMA and the 20-day EMA above the 50-day SMA"".  Of our 11 sectors, XLB is on the verge of meeting this definition as it prepares for a golden cross (20-day EMA crossing above 50-day SMA).  The only other two sectors not meeting this definition and still showing more work left on their charts are energy (XLE) and health care (XLV).  Here are the two charts:XLE:The XLE printed a tail beneath recent price support on Thursday, then recovered to test its nemesis, the 20-day EMA.  Currently, the XLE is caught between those two - price support near 82.50 and the 20-day EMA at 85.26.  Let's see which one breaks first.  In a bull market, I give the edge to the XLE breaking back above the 20-day EMA.XLV:The XLV seems to be a bit further along in its recovery attempt.  It currently resides right at key price and trendline resistance.  A breakout would be a solid piece of technical evidence that the ""correction bottom"" is in for the XLV.Top 10 Industries Last WeekRenewable energy ($DWCREE) jumped about 13% on Tuesday alone after the October CPI report was released.  The 290-300 area has proven to be difficult short-term resistance, so let's see if the group can power through that area this week:In that resistance zone is gap resistance and multiple price attempts at a breakout, so clearing it would definitely improve the technical picture here, perhaps even switching the overall trend from downtrend to uptrend.  Before you get too excited, however, please keep in mind that renewables have been lagging badly vs. the benchmark S&amp;P 500.  We've seen some improvement, but there's little leadership.  In other words, much of the current rebound can be attributed to very oversold conditions and a bounce, plus a very strong overall market.  It's the old Wall Street adage, ""a rising tide lifts all boats"".  In that bottom panel, breaking the relative downtrend is truly what this group needs.Bottom 10 Industries Last WeekI find about half of the above industry groups to be bullish on their charts.  Apparel retail ($DJUSRA) has been very strong since its early-June low and the recent selling appears to be a handle off of a cup:The huge spike in volume likely was the result of Gap's (GPS) massive volume, which accompanied a much-stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings report.  The DJUSIB, DJUSRD, DJUSMF, and DJUSHN all were among the 10 biggest losers last week, but still show technical promise, in my opinion.  The DJUSIB, in particular, looks solid, having broken to a 52-week high earlier this month and still trading well above its rising 20-day EMA.Top 10 Stocks - S&amp;P 500/NASDAQ 100Bottom 10 Stocks - S&amp;P 500/NASDAQ 100Big PictureWe cleared yet another hurdle on the S&amp;P 500 as we cleared the 4500 level.  After reaching a high of just over 4600 in July and pulling back to 4103.78 on October 27th, the bulls are back in charge.  The S&amp;P 500 is now nearing its 2023 high, just 2% away.  The recent recovery is just one more reason why I like to take a step back and view the ""Big Picture"", much more easily recognizing the current secular bull market:The bottom panel highlights the 240-month (20 year) rate of change (ROC).  I like to look at this for perspective.  While many bearish analysts believe we've run too far to the upside and have lots of downside ahead, this 240-month ROC tells me a completely different story.  This ROC has come nowhere close to the highs we saw in the previous two secular bull markets.  If anything, this suggests we could have much more upside ahead than any of us can imagine right now.  It's one reason why I believe the S&amp;P 500 could triple over the next 8-10 years, before we hit the next secular bear market.SentimentI look at two key sentiment readings - the Volatility Index ($VIX) and the equity-only put-call ratio ($CPCE).  Others use surveys, but I don't trust those.  After all, wouldn't you rather see what traders are doing with their money rather than their lips?  Yeah, me too.Volatility Index ($VIX)The first thing to understand is that the VIX is a calculation of ""expected volatility"" ahead.  The calculation is based on the pricing of short-term S&amp;P options.  I like to view this as my ""market maker sentiment reading"".  Market makers set the premiums that they require option holders to pay.  If market makers are looking to protect themselves against volatile market action, they'll put higher premiums on options.  If we're in a boring market environment (nearly always occurs in bullish market environments), premiums are much lower and indicative of little volatility ahead.  Market makers are giving us a GREAT BIG CLUE as to where they see the market heading.Typically, a VIX over 20 suggests a fairly high expectation of trouble ahead as when the VIX rises above 20, you really want to avoid taking any unnecessary risks on the long side.  Instead, you want to hunker down.  The higher the VIX level goes, the more volatile and scary the action can get.  VIX readings above 30 usually require market capitulation before we get a more tradable market on the long side.If the VIX is in the 17-20 range, I'm usually on high alert.  If it's falling in this range, it can a very bullish signal.  If it's rising in this range, however, and approaching 20, caution would be suggested as selling could escalate quickly.  At this point, if I was long and wanted to stay long, I might consider a covered call strategy, if you're familiar with options.  You'll get a nice premium and it's a way to at least hedge a little against your long positions.The most bullish environment is when the VIX is below 17 and declining.  We've seen that recently.  Here's where the VIX currently stands:Check out that first big spike in the VIX back in March.  That should be ingrained in your mind.  That's what can happen when the VIX moves through 20 resistance and accelerates.  The stock market took a tumble of roughly 250 points in one week.  The October scare saw the VIX jump 50% in a couple weeks, clearing 20 and reaching a high just above 23.  That coincided with another significant selloff as the S&amp;P 500 again lost about 250 points.Look at those thick red/blue directional lines in November, though.  As the VIX came tumbling down, we had a massive market rally as fear began to dwindle.  All of this occurred during what we already knew was THE most bullish period historically of the entire year.  This is how we can put puzzle pieces together in the short-term to increase our probability of making great market calls.Equity-Only Put-Call Ratio ($CPCE)While the VIX is a market-maker-related sentiment signal, the CPCE tells us what the retail trader is doing with their money.  Just keep in mind that when retail option traders all start to pile in on the same side of the trade, it usually ends in very ugly fashion for them.  We're looking for the ""rubber band to stretch"" significantly in either bullish or bearish fashion and we position ourselves on the opposite side, waiting for the ""snap back"".  In my experience, any time the 5-day SMA of the CPCE hits .75, extreme fear is building and we should begin looking for a market bottom.  Sometimes this 5-day SMA reading can reach as high as .85-.90 before a bottom is reached, so this isn't an exact science.  The main point I'm making is that, if you're shorting or trading equity puts, you need to understand that your profits could swiftly disintegrate once the 5-day SMA of the CPCE moves past .75.Here's a historical chart of the CPCE (5-day SMA) to illustrate how this works:The low 5-day SMA readings below .54-.56 have been solid signals in marking short-term tops, while high 5-day readings above .75 have been excellent in providing us clues of market bottoms.  The last reading was circled in red, because it occurred while the market was accelerating to the upside.  This tells me that we still have PLENTY of doubters as we rally.  I believe that's a very bullish signal.InflationOn Tuesday morning, the October CPI report was released, followed by the October PPI report on Wednesday morning.  Both reports continue to stress that inflation is FALLING and it has been consistently for over a year.  The stock market LOVES this news and is now rising to be priced accordingly.  Do you believe inflation remains a big problem?  Keep in mind that the Fed is most interested in Core CPI, so below you'll find a chart of the absolute monthly Core CPI numbers with two panels below.  The first shows the annual Core CPI (12-month rate of change) and the second panel shows the 1-month rate of change (ROC) of Core CPI:The annual rate is dropping every single month and is now back to 4%.  We're not at the Fed's target rate of 2%, but the last four monthly CPI increases have been in the ""normal range"" for the past 30-40 years, between 0.5% and 0.3%.  If inflation remains in this area, we'll be approaching the Fed's target inflation level by June 2023, which is when many analysts believe the Fed will start lowering interest rates to spark a slowing economy.  It's interesting how this inflation data lines up almost perfectly with that narrative.Intermarket AnalysisIn addition to following technical price action on our major indices, just like most technical analysts, I believe it's extremely important to monitor key intermarket relationships as well.  The two primary relationships for me are (1) XLY:XLP to watch the rotation between the more aggressive discretionary sector (XLY) and the more defensive staples sector (XLP), and (2) QQQ:SPY to observe the rotation between the more growth-oriented NASDAQ 100 and the more value-oriented S&amp;P 500.  The former is extremely important, because our GDP is comprised roughly of two-thirds consumer spending.  Watching to see where these consumer dollars are going helps us determine whether investors are in a ""risk on"" or ""risk off"" mode.  The former is bullish, while the latter is bearish.So where do these two relationships stand today?XLY:XLPMy analysis features this relationship ""ignoring gaps"" and ""including gaps"".  I believe the stock market is highly manipulated, especially at the opening bell.  A gap down is a great way to ""encourage"" unsuspecting traders to sell and a gap up is a great way to ""encourage"" those same unsuspecting traders to buy.  The top panel ignores that opening bell activity and focuses ONLY on the rotation during the trading day.  You can't plot this on a chart with regular data.  In order get this intraday rotation, you must keep a User-Defined Index at StockCharts, which is exactly what I do.  What we saw during much of the correction was a weak S&amp;P 500, but a strengthening XLY:XLP.  It was a rather important signal that the S&amp;P 500 selling would not last.  Now we see the result as our major indices scream higher once again.QQQ:SPYWhile the S&amp;P 500 has yet to break above its July high near 4600, this ratio has broken out whether we include or ignore gaps.  Again, it's a bullish signal as the big Wall Street firms buy into the more aggressive growth index, while simultaneously appearing on CNBC to spread indecision, fear, and sometimes, outright doom and gloom.  Follow the charts, not the lips on CNBC.Trade SetupI discuss potential trade setups here from a LONG-TERM perspective.  These are not trades where you're hoping to jump in, make 10-15%, then sell and move on to something else.  Instead, I focus here on stocks that generally have solid long-term track records.  Entering at the current level might make sense due to various factors.Today, I want to highlight Seagate Technology Holdings (STX) as it has performed better than the S&amp;P 500 over time and it also has performed much better than one of its primary competitors, Western Digital Corp (WDC).  I also like the recent technical breakout on STX after languishing mostly during the 2022 cyclical bear market and the recent market correction from July to October:Another positive with STX is that it pays a healthy $2.80 dividend ($.70 per quarter), which results in a 3.69% dividend yield, not a bad addition to the solid long-term capital appreciation.Looking AheadUpcoming Earnings:Earnings season is slowing down now and most big companies with calendar quarter ends (March, June, September, and December) have already reported their quarterly results.  There are a few, however, that do report in other months and you'll see below that NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) is one of those.  The following earnings reports (market cap in parenthesis) are, in my opinion, at least relatively significant and worth watching.  This is NOT a list of ALL companies reporting this week, so please be sure to check for earnings of any companies that you own or add:Monday:  A ($33 billion), KEYS ($24 billion), ZM ($19 billion)Tuesday:  NVDA ($1.2 trillion), LOW ($117 million), ADI ($90 billion)Wednesday:  DE ($109 billion)Thursday:  None - Market Closed for Thanksgiving Day HolidayFriday:  None - Market Closes Early at 1pm ETKey Economic Reports:Monday:  Leading indicatorsTuesday:  Existing home sales, FOMC minutesWednesday:  Initial jobless claims, durable goods, consumer sentimentThursday:  None - Market Closed for Thanksgiving Day HolidayFriday:  None - Market Closes Early at 1pm ETHistorical DataI'm a true stock market historian.  I am absolutely PASSIONATE about studying stock market history to provide us more clues about likely stock market direction.  While I don't use history as a primary indicator, I'm always very aware of it as a secondary indicator.  I love it when history lines up with all my other signals, providing me much more confidence to make particular trades.Each week, I'll provide you the average annualized returns for each calendar day and by index.  Here are the historical numbers for this week:S&amp;P 500November 20:  -32.39%November 21:  +55.64%November 22:  -1.21%November 23:  +49.61%November 24:  +127.98%NASDAQNovember 20:  -90.10%November 21:  +74.67%November 22:  -17.21%November 23:  +34.13%November 24:  +230.95%Russell 2000November 20:  -72.94%November 21:  +71.46%November 22:  -9.82%November 23:  +63.10%November 24:  +255.15%The S&amp;P 500 data dates back to 1950, while the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 information date back to 1971 and 1987, respectively.We are now in the most bullish period of the calendar year.  The close on October 27th through the close on January 18th is THE ABSOLUTE BEST TIME OF THE YEAR FOR U.S. EQUITIES - HISTORICALLY SPEAKING.   Last week was an ""ok"" period for equities, but the upcoming week typically sees much more historically-bullish action and this bullishness extends through the first week of December.Final ThoughtsAs we move into the Thanksgiving holiday season, let's keep a few things in mind:Historical bullishness should not be ignored.  73 years of data on the S&amp;P 500 tell us that NOW is the best time of the calendar year to be bullish and to be long.  Fight this historical bullishness at your own risk.The 10-year treasury yield ($TNX) has lost neckline support in a topping head &amp; shoulders pattern, with its initial measurement pegged near the 4.10% levelKey intermarket relationships point to the sustainability of the current S&amp;P 500 rally;  4600 is the next significant test, with a breakout likely sending us higher to test the all-time high near 4820NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) reports its earnings on Tuesday after the bell;  this will be significant not only for NVDA, but also for the entire semiconductor group ($DJUSSC).  I expect big numbers from NVDA, but it has run a lot in November, now testing critical price resistance at 500.Small caps (IWM) have shown improvement, but continue to watch the KRE (regional banking ETF) and XBI (widely-diversified biotech ETF) for clues about future relative strength;  these are the two industry groups that most heavily influence IWM performance.As I pointed out last week, TG Therapeutics (TGTX) is a strong short squeeze candidate, with over 27% of its float short.  The closing breakout level of 11.88 provided was cleared on Friday's close and we now see the result as TGTX is up more than 5.5% at my last look.  Volume is picking up and there's little overhead price resistance.  Shorts could be covering big time later today.  Wildly accelerating volume will be the major clue that a significant short squeeze is, in fact, underway.  Short squeeze trades are ALWAYS extremely risky, but this one has the potential to fly this week.I want to wish everyone a very happy Thanksgiving holiday weekend.  If you're traveling to be with friends and family, please be safe!FeedbackIf you'd like to share your thoughts on our Weekly Market Report, positive or negative, you can reach us at ""support@earningsbeats.com"".Happy trading!Tom",stockcharts,2023-11-27 17:19:08.020957
"Stock traders seem stunned by the recent fall in bond yields and the concurrent rally in stocks. As a result, short sellers have scrambled to reverse their bearish positions, which led to a gigantic short squeeze. But as short-selling upward pressure recedes, buyers must step up to keep the rally going.Regular readers of this column were not surprised by the rally, given the multiple alerts I posted noting the likelihood of a meaningful market bottom emerging, due to the extraordinary technical picture which had developed in the bond market and the ensuing gloom and doom in stocks as early as September 2023. And although there are no guarantees, the ongoing rally in both stocks and bonds has a great chance of continuing, due to the bullish seasonality which kicks into high gear with the traditional Thanksgiving rally.  So, how reliable is the Thanksgiving period as a launching pad? According to data compiled by Benzinga.com, Thanksgiving week delivers higher stock prices 68% of the time, with an average gain in the S&amp;P 500 of 0.64% compared to an average gain of only 0.16% for all the other weeks of the year. Therefore it pays to be prepared.  Bond Yields So far so good with the reversal in the bond market. The U.S. Ten-Year Note yield (TNX) is below 4.5% and its 50-day moving average. This is bullish for both stocks and bonds. A more important yield range is 4.3%-4.4%. A sustained break below this key yield band could take yields back to 4%.Of course, amongst the major beneficiaries of the lower interest rates have been the homebuilders, as reflected in the recent price action for the SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF (XHB), which is now trading above the $80 area and is due for a consolidation.Certainly, the long-term fundamentals of supply and demand in the housing market remain in favor of the homebuilders and related sectors. These include real estate investment trusts (REITs) which specialize in home rentals and related businesses.Another huge winner resulting from the drop in TNX has been the large-cap technology sector. This is clear in the price chart for the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), which is near its recent highs. QQQ has been powered higher by large-cap technology stocks, especially the wild ride in Microsoft (MSFT).And while both homebuilders and technology stocks have already realized big gains and are due for a consolidation, there are new sectors where investors may find value in this market, as I describe directly below.For more on homebuilder stocks, click here. For the perfect price chart set up, check out my latest Your Daily Five video here.Emerging Value in Unexpected AreasThe stock rally in the first half of 2023 was powered by the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. Indeed, for a while AI dominated money flows, until reality set in and rally fizzled. Interestingly, AI may be staging a quiet comeback, as money is once again trickling into the sector.A great way to invest in AI is via the Global X Robotics ETF (BOTZ), which topped out in August and crashed and burnt decisively until late October. Since then, it has mounted an increasingly credible rebound, which is now testing its 200-day moving average.Accumulation/Distribution (ADI) and On Balance Volume (OVB) are in sync, which is usually a bullish development, as it means short-covering (ADI) and actual buying (OBV) are occurring simultaneously. A move back to the $28-$29 area is quite possible over the next few weeks as the year-end rally unfolds.Another under-the-radar winning sector of late has been that of oil refiners. This is certainly counter-intuitive, as gasoline prices have fallen significantly due to lower demand and relatively high production. But the price chart disagrees with the doom and gloom in the news and money has been flowing into this area of the market.Moreover, the sector has rallied despite a decline in ADI, which means short sellers are still betting against it. On the other hand, OBV is in much better shape, which suggests value players are adding to positions in this ETF on dips.At some point, one of the two groups will gain supremacy and the ETF will make a big move. Right now, the price action is on the side of the bulls. There is great support at $32-$34. If this ETF breaks out above $36, it could move decidedly higher.Finally, I'm keeping an eye on the Van/Eck Vectors Rare Earth/Strategic Metals ETF (REMX). Specifically, I'm monitoring what happens over the next few weeks, given that a bottom seems to be forming above $55. Both ADI and OBV look awful, so I'm not keen to own this one, at least not yet.But as tensions between China, the world's leading rare earth minerals producer, and the U.S. persist, these natural resources are likely to move to the forefront of the Wall Street talk machine, which means that this ETF is one to keep tabs on.Aside from recommending multiple big winners in the homebuilder sector, I recently recommended a technology ETF which is now breaking out in a big way. Join the smart money at Joe Duarte in the Money Options.com where you can have access to this ETF and a wide variety of bullish stock picks FREE with a two week trial subscription.Market Breadth Improves; Big Test Lies AheadThe NYSE Advance Decline line (NYAD) has bottomed out and crossed above its 50-day moving average, but has not its yet reached the 200-day line. So, while there is improvement, we don't have a definitively bullish long-term signal for the market's trend, at least not yet. On the other hand, if the current trend stays in place, a move above the 200-day is on its way; which means that the odds of the rally accelerating are slowly rising. Most encouraging is the RSI indicator, which is nowhere near overbought, suggesting the rally still has room to move higher.For its part, the Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX) is nearing a breakout above 16,000 after rallying nicely above its 50-day moving average. Both ADI and OBV are now rising as short sellers cover (ADI) and buyers move in (OBV). A move above 15,800-16,000 would likely extend the rally further.The S&amp;P 500 (SPX) is well entrenched in a bullish trend, as it's now moved well above 4500. SPX is well above its 200-day moving average, returning to bullish territory after its recent dip below 4150. Moreover, it has now survived a test of the 4350 support area.VIX is Back Below 20The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) continues to fall, closing below 15 last week. This is bullish.A rising VIX means traders are buying large volumes of put options. Rising put option volume from leads market makers to sell stock index futures, hedging their risk. A fall in VIX is bullish, as it means less put option buying, and it eventually leads to call buying. This causes market makers to hedge by buying stock index futures, raising the odds of higher stock prices.To get the latest information on options trading, check out Options Trading for Dummies, now in its 4th Edition—Get Your Copy Now!
